// NUL-byte gate: no tracked text source file may contain a literal NUL.
//
// Git decides a file is binary by looking for a NUL byte near its start. A
// source file that carries one — typically a `'\0'` key separator whose escape
// was turned into the real character by an editor or a code generator — stops
// producing diffs, merges without conflict markers, and is skipped by
// `git grep`. The runtime value is identical when written as the `\0` escape, so
// the literal byte is never needed.
//
// Scans every tracked file with a text source extension (plus any untracked,
// non-ignored ones, so a new file is caught before its first commit).
// Exit 1 with file:line findings on any violation, 0 otherwise.
