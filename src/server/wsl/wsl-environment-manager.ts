// The Windows side's WSL servers (phase 7 spec, 5.2): one per distribution
// that has a chat to run, started on demand, reached through its front door,
// and let go when nothing has needed it for a while.
//
// Distributions are independent: each has its own server, data directory,
// transport and failure. One that cannot run a server says why and changes
// nothing for another.
//
// What a person sees of it is a status in words (`status`), which Settings ›
// Machines shows beside the distribution, and the reason a chat could not
// start when it could not.
//
// Lifetime:
// - `connect` starts the server, or reuses the running one. The starter's
//   stdin is the lease: a ping every fifteen seconds while it runs.
// - After `idleMs` (ten minutes) with no call and no chat working there, the
//   server is drained and stopped, so the VM can idle (decision R36).
// - A wire that closes is reconnected only once the server has answered a
//   ping: a server that died closes its wire a moment before `wsl.exe` says
//   it exited, and a reconnect meanwhile would read the dead server as a
//   loopback door that does not work.
// - A server that exits on its own is told apart by asking WSL: a
//   distribution now `Stopped` was shut down on purpose (`wsl --shutdown`,
//   `wsl --terminate`), and nothing starts it again until the person acts;
//   one still running crashed, and the next call restarts it after a backoff
//   that grows with each crash in a row.
// - Quitting drains every server for up to ten seconds, then lets the leases go.
