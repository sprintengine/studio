 * The toolsets the shell offers a server out of process (phase 6, 6.3,
 * decision R78): phase 5's browser and canvas, then the editor, tours,
 * terminals and agent launches, which act on a screen or a terminal the
 * shell holds.
 *
 * A toolset's tools are `<toolset>.<tool>` on the wire, so the terminal
 * family's `agent.launch` and `agent.status` ride an `agent` toolset beside
 * `terminal`, under the names agents already call. `backlog.work` stays the
 * server's: its family is, and no offer may shadow a family the server serves.
 * It starts its terminal through `ShellBridge.terminals`. The worktree pool's
 * `worktree` family is the shell's too: main keeps the pool, and a pool driven
 * from two processes would race over its slots.
