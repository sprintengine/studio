// What everything that drives or reads chats calls: the session API both IPC
// and the network wrap, the tailnet conversation host, the module conversation
// service, scheduled agents, companion agents and the IPC handlers.
//
// Today the only implementation is the in-process `ConversationRuntime`. The
// seam exists so a later phase can answer the same calls from another server
// (the one inside a WSL distribution, or one reached over SSH) and pick between
// them per workspace, without any of those callers changing. So a caller takes
// a `ConversationBackend`, never the runtime class, and a member belongs here
// only if a remote server could answer it too.
//
// What stays off it is the owner's business, on the owner handle the core
// hands out beside it: when its idle sweep runs, flushing and shutting down.

// `Pick` refuses a name the runtime does not have, so this list cannot drift
// from the class.
