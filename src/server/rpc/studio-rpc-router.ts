// The Studio RPC's methods, transport-free: given the grant a client holds at
// this moment, a method and its params, an answer. The connection reads the
// grant live and hands it here on every request, so a narrowed grant or a
// revoked client is refused at the next request, not the next connection.
//
// Three rules sit here rather than in the conversation host, because they are
// about who is asking:
//
// - Scope. Every method's scope comes from STUDIO_METHODS, checked first.
// - Ceiling. A paired app's chats run no looser than its ceiling, exactly as a
//   module's do (permission-ceiling.ts): a preset it asks for is lowered to the
//   ceiling, none asked for is pinned to it, and naming tools a chat may use
//   unasked needs the loosest ceiling. An app does not drive a chat that
//   already runs looser than its ceiling — it may read it, interrupt or stop
//   it, deny its requests and lower its preset, but not send to it or approve
//   for it — or the ceiling would hold only for chats the app started. A chat
//   running with tools it may use unasked counts as `bypass` for that check,
//   and answering a request for the rest of the conversation (an allow rule
//   for its kind) needs a ceiling of at least `auto`.
// - Command ids. A client's ids are namespaced by the client before they reach
//   the runtime's receipts (`client:<id>:<commandId>`, `owner:<commandId>`), as
//   a module's are (`module:<id>:<commandId>`), so one client can neither
//   collide with nor be answered from another's receipts.
//
// The chat surface (`chat.ts` in the protocol) is served only to owners, and
// only where main hands the router a chat backend. Its session commands reach
// the runtime's durable receipts by the same namespaced ids. Its other
// mutations (starting a session, a revert, a rewind, a fork) address a
// conversation rather than a session, which the runtime keeps no receipts
// for, so this router keeps them: the first answer to an id is the answer to
// every retry of it while this process runs.
//
// What a reply carries is redacted and a failure below is told in stable
// words, except to Studio's own windows (`context.ownWindow`): they are the
// app's own chat view, which reads the same conversations over IPC as they
// are, and a view showing a redacted usage count or a vaguer error than its
// IPC would have is a regression, not a protection.
