// Pictures a client sends ahead of the `session.send` that carries them. A
// frame holds about a megabyte and a picture may be five, so the bytes come in
// `uploads.append` pieces, and the send names the finished uploads by id.
//
// An upload belongs to the client that began it (its grant's id), so a window
// that reconnects can still finish and send what it staged. The budget is the
// connection's: as many uploads as one send may carry, twice over, at the
// largest size each may be, so one window cannot spend another's. An append
// from a new connection of the same client takes the upload into that
// connection's budget. When a connection closes, what it staged and did not
// send is kept only a minute, for its reconnect to take up. Anything left
// unsent goes after ten minutes; a sweep runs on a timer, not only when the
// next upload arrives. `uploads.discard` lets a client give back what it will
// not send.
//
// A send spends its uploads under its command id. Once the runtime holds that
// command's receipt, a repeat of the send is answered from the receipt and
// never needs the pictures again, so their bytes are let go of then; the
// router asks for the receipt before it spends anything. If the send left no
// receipt (nothing ran), its uploads go back to unsent, for a retry to carry.
