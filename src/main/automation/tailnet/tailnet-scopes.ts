 * it could not see, answer or stop. What a paired device starts is a chat
 * (`conversation.create`), which it can follow. These stay on the local
 * socket, where the agents that call them can see the
 * terminals they start. The rest of the `terminal.*` family is local-only by
 * its prefix, below.

 * Why a tool is served on the local socket only and never to a paired device,

 *
 * The `tailnet.*` family configures who may drive this machine. A device that
 * could call it could mint a pairing code granting scopes wider than its own,
 * and revoking the device it came in on would not take those away — one grant
 * manufacturing the next is not something a scope can express, so the family
 * sits outside the scope vocabulary entirely rather than behind a very wide one.
 * A prefix rule rather than a list: a tool added to the family later is
 * local-only by default, which is the direction a mistake here should fail.
 *
 * The terminal tools are the other kind: not dangerous to name in a grant,
 * just of no use to anyone who cannot see a terminal. The `terminal.*` family
 * is a prefix rule for the same reason the `tailnet.*` one is; the launchers
 * outside it are named.
 *
 * The `pull_request.*` family records a pull request as the calling agent's
 * conversation's, and a paired device has no conversation to record it under.
 * The `local_server.*` family is the same, for a server the agent started.

/**

 * classification, so the two lists cannot drift — a tool newly classified as a
 * mutation immediately needs the operate grant here too.
 *
 * `workspace` is the deliberate catch-all for the app-wide families
 * (`workspace.*`, `agent.*`, `cli.*`, `module.*`, `marketplace.*`,
 * `schedule.*`, `editor.*`, `review_*`) and for any tool this mapping has not
 * been taught. `editor.open` and `editor.open_diff` change what is on the
 * person's screen, so they are mutations and need `workspace:operate`.
 * Unknown does not mean unrestricted: an unmapped mutation still requires
 * `workspace:operate`, so a device without it is refused rather than served.
 *
 * A local-only tool never reaches this function: it is refused first.
