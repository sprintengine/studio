// An agent can only start an agent with the permissions it has itself (owner
// ruling 2026-09-29). Without this, one gateway call — `agent.launch` with
// `permissionPreset: "bypass"` — lets an agent the person deliberately runs on
// `none` hand any prompt to a fresh agent that never asks, and a prompt
// injection in a README is enough to make that call.
//
// Only a connection that declared itself one of this app's agents is capped.
// The person's own scripts (no identity) and paired tailnet devices (a proven
// device identity, gated by their scopes) keep launching on any preset, as the
// person can from the launcher.
//
// The threat model is the agent, not the machine. The identity is declared by
// the bridge from the agent's environment, and anything that can open the
// socket could declare another agent's — but writing raw frames to a socket
// needs a shell, and an agent on `none` asks the person before it runs one. So
// a capped agent cannot shed its cap by tool calls alone, which is the path
// this closes; a connection that has declared an agent cannot re-declare
// itself as another one or as none at all (mcp-dispatch.ts).
