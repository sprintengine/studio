/**
 * How to start an agent CLI that speaks a protocol over stdio.
 *
 * On Windows the resolved command is often an npm shim, `codex.cmd` or
 * `codex.ps1`, and neither is an executable Node can spawn without a shell.
 * A batch shim runs through the command processor and a PowerShell shim
 * through PowerShell, with the rest of the argv passed as it is. Everything
 * else, and every command on macOS and Linux, is spawned directly.
 *
 * The command processor re-reads its line, so the line is built here rather
 * than by Node: every argument quoted, `/s` stripping only the outer pair.
 * Inside quotes the command processor still expands `%VAR%` and ends at a
 * quote, so an argument carrying either is refused instead of being
 * reinterpreted. The arguments are the app's own (`acp`, `app-server`) and the
 * path the CLI was found at.
 *
 * The command processor cannot start in a UNC folder: given one (a folder
 * inside a distribution, `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\…`, which a chat on This PC
 * may run in) it starts in the Windows folder instead, and so would the CLI.
 * There an npm batch shim is read for what it runs (`npmShimTarget`), and
 * that is started directly, which keeps the folder. Not the PowerShell shim
 * npm writes beside it: Windows PowerShell holds a piped stdin until it
 * closes, so a protocol's first request never arrives, and it re-encodes
 * that stdin as ASCII and drops an empty argument or a quote in one. A batch
 * file that is not an npm shim is refused with the way out, rather than run
 * in the wrong folder.
