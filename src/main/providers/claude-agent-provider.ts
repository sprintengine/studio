// Stateful conversation provider backed by the Claude Agent SDK.
//
// Spawns the user's own installed Claude Code CLI headlessly (subscription
// auth — whatever `claude auth login` already holds; no API key touches this
// path) and maps the SDK's message stream onto the studio's canonical
// ConversationEvents. One long-lived child process per session, kept across
// turns via the SDK's streaming-input mode; the CLI session id is surfaced as
// `session_updated` events so the runtime can resume natively after the
// process (or the whole app) goes away.
//
// All Claude Agent SDK types are confined to this file on purpose — the SDK
// moves fast, so version churn must not leak past this adapter. The package
// is ESM-only and the main bundle is CJS, so the SDK is loaded via dynamic
// import on first use.
