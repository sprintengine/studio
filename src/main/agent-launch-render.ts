//    marker naming the file main wrote it to, so the agent can read the rest —
//    a launch that loses the tail of its context beats one that does not start.
// 2. A prompt that does not fit leaves argv by the manifest's
//    `promptInjection.overflow`: typed in once the CLI is ready (the default),
//    or written to a file the CLI documents an option for.
// 3. If the launch is still over, the context is cut to what room is left; and
//    if that is not enough either, the launch goes as rendered and says so in
//    the log. A launch that fits is never changed, context included.
//
// A `send-after-ready` manifest never puts the prompt on the command line: its
// CLI documents no way to take a first message there, so every new launch that
// carries one types it in, whatever its length. A resume never does — the
