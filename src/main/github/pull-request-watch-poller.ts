/**
 * The pull-request watch: a backoff-scheduled re-probe of things whose state
 * changes on GitHub, outside the app, long after the local work finished.
 *
 * This is the machinery `sprintengine-pr-merge-poller.ts` was built as for
 * MC-2155 (a sprint run's merge state self-healing with no window open),
 * generalised over `{ key, isWatchable, probe }` so the conversation pull
 * request record (`main/pull-request-record.ts`, epic `pull-request-marks`
 * decision 9) is a second consumer of the SAME schedule rather than a second
 * schedule with the same comments. The sprint run remains a consumer; its
 * backoff table, jitter, coalescing window and boot-scan bound are unchanged.
 *
 * WHAT A KEY IS is the consumer's business: a run's state path there, a pull
 * request URL here. The poller only ever asks two things about one — "is this
 * still worth probing" and "probe it" — and both are the consumer's to answer.
 *
 * THE SCHEDULE. 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 min, then HOLDING at 32 until the key
 * stops being watchable, at which point its timer is torn down for good. It
 * deliberately does not halt at the cap: a headless owner has no "the user came
 * back" trigger to re-arm it, and a watch that goes silent an hour in does not
 * self-heal at all. When nothing is watchable the poller holds zero timers —
 * the no-steady-state-polling rule is about the app at rest, not about a pull
 * request that is genuinely still open.
 *
 * JITTER. Arming a whole scan's worth of keys in one pass would fire their
 * probes in lockstep — a burst of `gh` subprocesses on one tick. Each delay is
 * spread by ±{@link PR_WATCH_JITTER_RATIO}.
 *
 * COALESCING. `noteChanged` is fired by change funnels that run several times a
 * minute; the answer to "is this watchable" changes about once per key. At most
 * one re-evaluation per key per {@link PR_WATCH_CHANGE_COALESCE_MS}, with a
 * single trailing one for notifications that arrived inside the window. Well
 * under the base delay, so a newly-opened pull request still arms long before
 * its first probe would fire.
