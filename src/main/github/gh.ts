// THE `gh` runner for the whole main process (epic `pull-request-marks`,

// GitHub CLI — never REST — so that gh's own credential store is the single
// auth source and GitHub Enterprise Server hosts come free.
//
// It lives here, in a neutral module, because it used to live inside the review
// provider while a second, weaker spawner sat in `automations/pull-request.ts`.
// The two were not equivalent: only this one looks gh up on the user's login
// shell PATH, and a GUI-launched app on macOS does not inherit the shell PATH, so a
// Homebrew or nvm `gh` was invisible to the weaker one — which reported "no
// pull request" for a pull request that was plainly there. One runner, one
// answer.
//
// THE `found` FLAG IS THE POINT. `found: false` means the binary itself is
// absent; anything else is gh having run and having an opinion. A caller that
// writes an answer down must tell those apart: "there is no pull request" and
// "I could not ask" are different facts, and only the first may be recorded.
