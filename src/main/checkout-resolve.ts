/**
 * Resolve an observed cwd into the checkout that contains it.
 *
 * The cwd comes from an agent's lifecycle hooks — it says where the session
 * IS, not what kind of checkout that is. Git answers the second question, in
 * one `rev-parse` (it is asked at every agent turn end, so each extra process
 * start is paid many times a minute across a fleet):
 *
 *   - `--show-toplevel`                   → the work tree root (realpath-resolved)
 *   - `--git-common-dir` vs
 *     `--absolute-git-dir`                → a linked worktree has its own git
 *                                           dir apart from the common one
 *   - the common dir's parent             → the PRIMARY checkout the worktree
 *                                           belongs to (`<root>/.git` ⇒ root)
 *   - the git dir's HEAD file             → the branch (null when detached)
 *
 * A directory already answered is not asked again until its HEAD file changes.
 *
 * Three outcomes, kept distinct because a consumer renders them differently:
 *   1. a checkout (facts, `gitRoot` set) — primary or linked worktree;
 *   2. not a checkout (`gitRoot` null) — a plain folder, a removed worktree, a
 *      bare repo's directory, the inside of a `.git` dir;
 *   3. null — git could not answer at all (binary missing, a path this host
 *      cannot run git in such as a WSL path reported to a Windows main). The
 *      caller leaves the observation unresolved and falls back to launch
 *      intent rather than reading "folder" into a tooling failure.
