# The SSH machine the phase 8 integration suites connect to (spec 9.3):
# Ubuntu with OpenSSH, a `dev` user whose key is injected at run time, and a
# `.bashrc` that prints a line above its interactive guard, as many do, so
# every exchange has noise before its first marker. python3 serves the dev
# page the pane suites load through the relay.
