  //     slowest.
  //  4. What the terminal legs fed: captured pull requests. Then the chat
  //     sessions' own stop, the canvas's in-flight write, and the registry
  //     once more for anything the legs above changed.
  //  5. The integrations the app writes into repositories, now that no agent
  //     it launched is left to run them (a cut-short removal resumes next quit).
