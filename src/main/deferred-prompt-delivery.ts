// Delivering a first message the launch's command line could not carry.
//
// `planAgentLaunch` moves a prompt that is too long for the platform's argv off
// the command line, and the CLI starts without it. This types it in: one
// bracketed paste and one Enter, written into the pty once the CLI is ready for
// input — exactly once, and never after the CLI has gone.
//
// "Ready" is read from the CLI's own output, because every agent CLI the app
// drives says so the same way: its line editor turns on bracketed paste
// (`ESC[?2004h`) when it starts reading. That is necessary but not sufficient —
// verified against the installed CLIs, Claude Code turns it on ~200 ms in but
// drops a paste that arrives before it has finished drawing its first screen,
// ~1 s in; a paste written once output had been quiet for half a second after
// the mode came on landed every time, in Claude Code, Codex and Cursor alike.
// So the paste waits for the mode AND a quiet screen. A lifecycle hook frame
// (SessionStart) counts as the mode for a CLI that reports one without drawing
// a line editor the mode test would recognise.
//
// Two ways out that are not a delivery: the CLI exits first (nothing is written;
// there is nobody left to read it), or the delivery is cancelled with the
// session. And one fallback: a CLI that never turns the mode on still gets the
// message once the fallback window has passed, because a prompt that never
// arrives is the failure this exists to prevent.
//
// Some CLIs turn the mode on for a dialog before their composer — Kimi Code's
// "Trust this folder?" does, with "Trust" selected, so the Enter would trust the
// folder. Their manifests declare an `output-match` readiness instead: the
// message waits for text only the composer screen prints, and a CLI that never
// prints it within the window gets nothing typed at all. That is abandoned as
// `not-ready`, and the caller hands the message back to the person rather than
// typing it blind into a screen nobody recognised.
//
// "The CLI exits" is not the pty exiting. An agent launch runs the CLI from a
// startup script that then execs an interactive shell, and a modern shell turns
// bracketed paste on too: a CLI that died at startup would hand the message to
// the shell, whose Enter runs it. So a launch whose prompt is typed in prints
// `CLI_EXITED_SENTINEL` (an OSC nothing renders) between the CLI and the shell,
// and seeing it abandons the delivery exactly as a pty exit does.
