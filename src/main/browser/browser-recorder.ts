// recording per tab (start, the limits that end it, stop, the file it leaves).
//
// Two things are kept behind interfaces, so this file is all of the policy and
// none of the Electron:
//
// - The ENCODER turns the tab into WebM bytes. The desktop's encoder runs in
//   the window that hosts the tab (`recording-encoder.ts` and the pane's
//   `browserRecording.ts`): Chromium captures the guest's own frames, the
//   agent's cursor is drawn over them, and MediaRecorder encodes. Its chunks
//   arrive here in order, about one a second.
// - The OUTPUT is where the bytes go: a file in the calling agent's workspace
//   (`recording-output.ts`), so the agent reads the result with its own file
//   tools, wherever it runs. An output that cannot be made (no folder, or a
//   workspace whose files Studio cannot write) is refused before anything is
//   captured.
//
// The person always knows: while a recording runs, the tab's state says so
// (`BrowserTabState.recording`), and the pane's toolbar shows it with a timer
// and a Stop button that ends it like the agent's own stop would.
