// "Create patch from changes…" and "Copy as patch" (epic `git-commit-window`,
// T6; mockup 2522 panel 3).
//
// THE PATCH COMES FROM GIT, NOT FROM THE PANEL. The renderer knows which rows
// are selected and nothing else — it has no hunks, no blob contents, and no way
// to spell a rename. So the selection travels here as paths and `git diff`
// writes the patch, which is also what makes the result something `git apply`
// will actually take.
//
// TWO SIDES OF THE INDEX. `cached` picks `git diff --cached` (HEAD↔index) over
// `git diff` (index↔worktree), the same distinction the row's own diff opens
// on, so "create a patch from what I am about to commit" and "…from what I have
// not staged" are both sayable.
//
// UNTRACKED FILES ARE THE AWKWARD ONES. `git diff` cannot see a file git does
// not know about, and the fix people reach for — `git add -N` — writes to the
// index, which is not something a "copy this to the clipboard" action may do
// behind someone's back. `git diff --no-index /dev/null <file>` produces the
// same creation hunk without touching anything, and exits 1 by design when it
// finds a difference, so its stdout is taken on the failure path as well.
