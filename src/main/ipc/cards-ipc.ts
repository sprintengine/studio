// `cards:run` — the one channel behind `Go` on the Extensions home (item 2469).
//
// It is shaped like the skills and MCP install channels beside it: one handler,
// one envelope in, one report out, and the service objects bound here rather
// than reached for inside the executor. `src/main/cards/run-card.ts` takes its
// installers as dependencies precisely so that this file is the only place that
// knows which real service each one is, and so the executor's own test can
// watch the order without a workspace, a network or a machine with a CLI on it.
//
// **The envelope is re-parsed, not trusted.** The actions were validated once
// already, by `parseHostedCardFeed` in the main process, but they have been to
// the renderer and back since — so every action is put through the shared
// parser again here, and a card that fails is refused whole rather than run in
// part. That is the same rule the feed parser applies to a card with one bad
// action, for the same reason: half of Go is worse than none of it.
//
// The fields the request carries that a card does not — the workspace, the
// parent directory clones go into, the MCP servers this machine has configured
// and whether MCP sync is on — are the app's own facts, and they never came
// from the feed. They are still checked here, because "the renderer sent it" is
// a claim about a process, not about a shape: the two paths are checked for
// shape and rejected when relative, every server is put through
// `normalizeMcpServerConfig` — the same normalizer the settings store uses —
// rather than cast, and the picker row's three launch axes (item 2473) are
// checked the same way. The header claimed the checking until 2026-09-06 while
// `raw.mcpServers` went through untouched, which would have let a malformed row
// reach a sync and be written into every CLI's config.
