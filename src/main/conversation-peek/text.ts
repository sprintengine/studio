 * so the text it is handed has to already be the sentence — not the sentence
 * plus the 400-line file they pasted under it, not the sentence plus the four
 * repo paths they dropped onto the terminal. Collapsing happens BEFORE the
 * character cap for exactly that reason: capping first would spend the whole
 * budget on a fenced block and truncate away the request itself, and the card
 * would then honestly report "+3,900 more" about text nobody typed.
 *
 * A path-shaped token is shortened to its basename rather than deleted: a
 * dropped file is part of what the person asked, and "read USAGE.md" says so in
 * less room than the full path. That is the difference between this module and
 * `stripInjectedFragments`, whose consumer (the derived title) throws paths
 * away. Both read the same patterns (`INJECTED_FRAGMENT_PATTERNS`) so the two
 * routes cannot disagree about what counts as a path.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no Electron, no DOM. Every input is untrusted — the text comes
 * from a CLI's hook report, written by another process.
