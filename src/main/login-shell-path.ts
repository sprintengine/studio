/**
 * The PATH a person's own terminal would have, resolved once, and binary lookup
 * against it done in this process.
 *
 * Detecting whether an agent CLI is installed used to start a login shell per
 * CLI — `bash -lc`, then the person's own `$SHELL -ilc` for anything bash could
 * not see — and ask it `command -v`. With ten registered CLIs that is up to
 * twenty shells, each sourcing a `.zshrc` that may load nvm, on every refresh:
 * at boot, and again whenever the pickers asked after the cache ran out. The
 * only thing any of those shells contributed was their PATH, and a PATH does
 * not change between one CLI and the next. So one shell prints it, and every
 * lookup after that is a directory walk in this process.
 *
 * One resolver serves the whole process (`sharedLoginShellPath`). CLI
 * detection, the gh runner and the local-server runner each used to keep their
 * own, so one session started a shell per caller — three or four `$SHELL -ilc`
 * runs at boot, each loading the same `.zshrc` — to learn one PATH.
 *
 * The memo lives for the app session. It is dropped on a forced refresh (an
 * install or an explicit re-check in Settings), because an installer is exactly
 * the thing that appends a line to `~/.zshrc`, and the answer that follows it
 * must see the new directory. A failed resolution is never kept: the next
 * caller tries again rather than inheriting a PATH that is missing the person's
 * own entries for the rest of the session.
 *
 * Host POSIX only (macOS, Linux). WSL and Windows keep their shell probes.
