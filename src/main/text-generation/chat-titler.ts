/**
 * Titling a chat from what the person first said in it, in the process that
 * runs the chat.
 *
 * A window used to do this, from its list of chat sessions, and that list
 * stands still while the window cannot be seen and does not exist with no
 * window open. So a chat started from a phone — by a person who is, by
 * definition, away from the desk — kept the heuristic title at best, and
 * "Chat N" when its first message came with pictures and so after the chat
 * was made. Here the title follows the chat's own events, whichever door the
 * message came through: a window, a phone, a paired machine, a schedule.
 *
 * The two halves are the window's, in the same order
 * (`renderer/src/store/generatedWorkspaceTitle.ts`): the heuristic lands at
 * once, and when the person has model-written titles on and a supported agent
 * CLI is installed, the model's title replaces it when it arrives. The rules
 * that keep it honest are the store's (`applyGeneratedWorkspaceTitle`), kept
 * the same:
 *
 * - A locked name is never touched. A hand rename locks, an explicit name at
 *   birth is locked, and a title that lands locks too, so the name stops
 *   moving with the chat's next message.
 * - A late model title replaces exactly the name it was asked to replace, so a
 *   rename the person made while it was being written stands.
 *
 * One model call per chat workspace, whatever comes of it: a title nobody is
 * waiting on is not worth a second call per message. Later messages still get
 * the heuristic while the name is open, which is what covers a first message
 * with no words to title from.
 *
 * Studio's own messages (an agent's notice, a resume after a usage limit) are
 * not the person asking for anything, and title nothing.
 *
 * Failure is silence, as in the window: the diagnostics log says which engine
 * was asked and what it said, and the chat keeps the name it has.
