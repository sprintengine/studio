/**
 * What `Go` does, and what it refuses to do (item 2469).
 *
 * Every installer is injected, so this suite is about the EXECUTOR and not
 * about installing anything: there is no workspace on disk, no MCP catalogue,
 * no source store and no git. What is asserted is the four things only this
 * module can be wrong about.
 *
 *   1. The order. A card is an ordered list and the whole point of `open.chat`
 *      being last is that the chat opens onto tools that are already there, so
 *      the happy path asserts a call LOG rather than a set of calls.
 *   2. The first failure stops the rest, and says which ones did not run. A
 *      toast that named only what broke would leave the person guessing how
 *      much of the card had happened.
 *   3. A second press is a no-op. Pressing Go twice must not install twice,
 *      and "already there" is a success, not an error.
 *   4. `open.chat` is the last action or the card is refused before anything
 *      runs — a chat attached to a server that failed to install is worse than
 *      no chat.
 *
 * Plus the boundary: an id a feed made up resolves against nothing this app
 * holds, and a repository name is re-checked here rather than taken on the
 * parser's word.
 *
 * And, since item 2473, the pass-through: `Go` opens the model picker and
 * choosing a row is what runs the card, so the row's model, effort and
 * permission preset ride the request. The executor must hand all three back
 * untouched — it is an installer, and none of the three means anything to one.
