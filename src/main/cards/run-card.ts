// What `Go` does. One press on a card on the Extensions home runs the card's
// ordered actions and the person lands in a chat that is already working
// (backlog/2026-09-06-go-runs-a-cards-actions.md, item 2469).
//
// **Go goes** (owner ruling R4, 2026-09-06). There is no consent screen here,
// no plan, no progress modal and no "are you sure": the card said what it was,
// the person pressed the button that said Go, and `open.chat` carries `send`
// because an unstated send would leave the reader guessing. So this module is
// deliberately quiet — it returns what happened, and the surface says it in a
// toast if anything went wrong.
//
// **It composes; it never re-implements.** Every install goes through the
// module that already owns that concern and already records provenance:
// `mcpConfigService` for a catalogue server, `skills/install.ts` (through the
// skills service) for a skill, `skills/install-plugin.ts` for a plugin,
// `git-clone.ts` for a clone. Nothing here writes a file and nothing here
// spawns a process — the acceptance criterion is that no shell command is
// spawned *by this file*, and the way that is kept true is that this file has
// no `child_process` import and no `fs` write in it at all. What the installers
// it calls do inside themselves is their own contract, tested in their own
// suites.
//
// **Actions run in order, and the first failure stops the rest.** There is no
// `Promise.all` anywhere below, on purpose: a card that installs a server and
// then opens a chat against it has an ordering the person can see, and racing
// the two would open a chat against a server that is not there yet. Everything
// after a failure is reported as `skipped`, so the toast can say what did not
// run rather than only what broke.
//
// **An already-satisfied action is a no-op, not an error.** Pressing Go twice
// must not install twice: a server already in the settings, a skill directory
// already carrying this source's provenance marker, a plugin already in the
// install receipts, a CLI already on the machine and a clone target that is
// already a directory all report `already` and the run carries on. That is what
// makes the second press land the person in the chat again instead of in a
// toast about a duplicate.
//
// **Workspace scope is the app's, never the card's.** No `CardAction` carries a
// workspace, by design (`src/shared/hosted-card-feed.ts`): a card that could
// name one could reach into a project the person was not looking at. The
// executor is handed the workspace the person is in, and `clone.repo` is the
// one verb that makes a new one — everything after it in the same card runs in
// that clone, which is why `workspaceRoot` below is a `let` that only
// `clone.repo` reassigns and why the result hands the final value back.
//
// **Nothing a feed says is trusted as a path, a URL or an argument.** Every id
// is resolved against something this app already holds before it is used: a CLI
// against the registered agent-CLI plugin ids, an MCP server against
// `listCatalog()`, a skill and a plugin against that source's own scan, and a
// repository against the `owner/name` shape re-checked here rather than taken
// on the parser's word. `clone.repo`'s URL is built from a fixed
// `https://github.com/` prefix and the two validated segments, so a card names
// a repository and can never name a host. The whole of what a card contributes
// to a filesystem path is one already-single-segment folder name, re-checked
// below and joined onto a parent directory the app chose.
//
// That sentence shipped on 2026-09-06 as an unqualified claim and it was not
// true, in two places, both closed here:
//
//  - **The prompt IS an argument.** `open.chat`'s prompt travels through
//    `cliStartupPrompt` to `renderAgentLaunchArgv` and comes out as the
//    `{{prompt}}` positional — the last argv token, with no `--` in front of
//    it. The shell never saw it unquoted, so nothing could be injected into a
//    command line; the CLI's own option parser is another matter, and a card
//    carrying `"prompt": "--permission-mode=bypassPermissions"` was accepted by
//    the parser and handed to `claude` as a flag. A prompt beginning with `-`
//    is now refused by the shared parser AND again in `openChat` below: the
//    parser keeps such a card out of the feed, and this file is the boundary
//    the value crosses last, so neither is allowed to be the only check.
//  - **An existing directory is not proof of a clone.** `clone.repo` adopted
//    any directory that already existed at its target path as the run's
//    workspace — and the parent directory is the parent of the person's own
//    projects, so a card naming `x/my-other-project` silently installed into
//    the project beside it and scoped the chat there. A directory is now only
//    "already there" when its `origin` remote is the repository the card named;
//    anything else fails the action by name rather than borrowing the folder.

//
// **`open.chat` and `open.surface` are not run here.** Main cannot open a chat
// or move a door; the renderer can. Both verbs are validated in the same switch
// as the rest and returned as a hand-off for the surface to perform once every
// install before them has succeeded. That is also why `open.chat` must be the
// last action or the card is refused outright: a chat attached to a server that
// failed to install is worse than no chat.
//
// **The chosen model row passes straight through** (owner ruling R4b,
// 2026-09-06, item 2473). Since Go opens the model picker and choosing a row is
// what starts the run, the request carries that row's model, reasoning effort
// and permission preset. This file reads none of them — they mean something to
// a launcher and nothing to an installer — and hands all three back on the chat
// hand-off, beside the cli a `require.cli` verified, so that one object on the
// far side describes the whole launch rather than half of it.
