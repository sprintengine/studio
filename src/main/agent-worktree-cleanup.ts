/**
 * Removes the agent worktrees nobody needs any more, and nothing else.
 *
 * Agent worktrees used to be created and never removed: every agent spawned
 * "with a worktree" left a checkout (and usually a gigabyte of dependencies)
 * behind for good. This is the sweep that reclaims them, and it is built to be
 * safe to run unattended, which means every rule below errs towards keeping.
 *
 * A worktree is removed only when ALL of these hold:
 *
 * 1. **It is an agent worktree.** Its branch is `agent/<slug>` and it lives in
 *    the app's own worktree container (`.sprintengine-worktrees`). Every other
 *    worktree goes by the stricter rules for other worktrees below.
 * 2. **Nothing uses it.** No path the caller protects — every workspace's
 *    folder and worktree, every agent still holding one — and no live terminal
 *    session sits in it. Paths are compared with symlinks resolved on both
 *    sides (git records a worktree's resolved path; the app records whatever
 *    was opened), and case-folded on macOS and Windows. The caller's list is
 *    read per repository, after the listing, so it is never older than what it
 *    is checked against.
 * 3. **No other owner has locked it.** Every agent worktree is locked as it is
 *    created (agent-worktree-lock.ts), which is what protects it from another
 *    Studio profile's sweep, and from this one's between reading its records
 *    and listing the repository. A lock this profile placed is released here
 *    once the path is no longer protected (it is unlocked right before the
 *    removal, and locked again if the removal does not go through). Another
 *    profile's lock, or one a person placed, keeps the worktree. An unattended
 *    sweep (`ownedOnly`) goes further and takes nothing this profile did not
 *    lock: an unlocked agent worktree may belong to another profile on an
 *    older build, so only a person's cleanup from the Worktree manager decides
 *    on it. One this profile uses and finds unlocked, it locks.
 * 4. **It is registered and present.** A missing or prunable one is reported
 *    and left for `worktree prune`, which the person runs.
 * 5. **Git has not touched it for an hour.** Its admin directory
 *    (`<common>/worktrees/<name>`) was last written more than an hour ago: a
 *    new worktree is clean and has no commits, so without this it would
 *    qualify the moment it exists, before any owner is recorded.
 * 6. **It is clean.** `git status` reports nothing, untracked files included.
 * 7. **Its work is on the default branch** (`origin/HEAD`, else `origin/main`
 *    or `origin/master`; with no remote, the local `main` or `master`). Either
 *    its HEAD has no commit the default branch lacks (a branch that never got
 *    a commit has none by definition), or — for a squash-merged branch, whose
 *    commits are not on the trunk by hash — merging it into the default
 *    branch would produce the default branch's own tree, so its changes are
 *    already there (`changesAlreadyIn`). On a git too old for that test the
 *    ancestry rule alone decides, and a squash-merged branch is kept.
 *    An agent worktree nothing uses is taken unmerged too (owner ruling
 *    2026-10-08: a settled chat counts as deleted): its commits stay on its
 *    `agent/` branch, which the branch cleanup below never deletes while
 *    unmerged, exactly as a pool slot's do when the pool takes it back.
 * 8. **Nothing git does not show would be lost.** No tracked file is hidden
 *    from `status` by `--assume-unchanged` or `--skip-worktree`, and every
 *    ignored file is either rebuildable output (dependencies, build output,
 *    caches) or a `.worktreeinclude` copy still identical to the source
 *    checkout's (agent-worktree-keep-checks.ts). An edited `.env`, notes in an
 *    ignored folder, a `*.local` scratch file: each keeps the worktree.
 *
 * The removal itself is `git worktree remove` WITHOUT `--force`, so git checks
 * cleanliness again at the moment of removal: anything written between the
 * check above and the removal makes git refuse, and the sweep reports the
 * refusal. The branch itself is kept by the removal.
 *
 * **Every other worktree of the repository** (owner ruling 2026-10-08): one
 * made by hand, by an agent CLI on its own (`.claude/worktrees/…`), in the
 * Worktree manager, or by an automation run that never finished. They used to
 * be left alone for good, and a busy repository gathered dozens of them, each
 * a full checkout. Such a worktree goes by rules 2 and 4 to 8 like an agent
 * worktree, with these differences:
 *
 * - **Any lock keeps it.** Nothing here locked it, so nobody here may lift it.
 * - **It was last used more than a day ago** (`OTHER_WORKTREE_MIN_IDLE_MS`),
 *   by its index and HEAD (`worktreeLastUsedAt`), on top of rule 5. A person
 *   who just merged a branch may still be reading it.
 * - **Unmerged work goes too, after a week unused**
 *   (`UNMERGED_WORKTREE_MIN_IDLE_MS`), when its HEAD is on a branch, or on a
 *   commit some branch or remote branch holds. Removing a worktree never
 *   deletes its branch (this sweep deletes only merged `agent/` branches), so
 *   every commit stays where it was and the branch can be checked out again;
 *   what a removal could lose (uncommitted, hidden and ignored work) keeps it
 *   by rules 6 and 8 as before. A detached HEAD on commits no ref holds is kept.
 * - **It is never locked for being in use.** Being found in use keeps it.
 *
 * It is taken unattended too: the lock rule in 3 exists to tell one Studio
 * profile's agent worktrees from another's, and no profile owns these. The
 * main checkout, and any worktree it sits inside, is never one.
 *
 * **Worktree pool slots** (worktree-pool/) are never removed here. The pool
 * owns them: a slot nobody uses is handed back to it, which detaches it and
 * keeps its ignored files for the next agent, or holds it when it still has
 * work in it. The pool's own rules decide (`returnUnused`); this sweep only
 * supplies what the app's records use, and reports what the pool did.
 *
 * **Merged agent branches** are deleted afterwards (owner ruling 2026-10-05):
 * an `agent/` branch that no worktree has checked out, that no record of the
 * app's names (`keepBranches`: a chat is restored from its branch), and whose
 * work is on the default branch by rule 7 holds nothing anyone still needs.
 * Git itself refuses to delete a branch some worktree has checked out at that
 * moment. A caller that names no records deletes nothing.
 *
 * Every decision is logged, removals and keeps alike.
