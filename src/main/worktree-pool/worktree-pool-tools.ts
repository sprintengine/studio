// The worktree pool's tools: how an agent that wants a worktree of its own
// gets one from the pool instead of running `git worktree add` itself (owner
// ruling 2026-10-05). A worktree an agent makes itself is a fresh checkout with
// nothing installed, forked from whatever its checkout is on, and nobody
// cleans it up; one leased here is on the default branch, keeps the last
// agent's dependencies, and goes back to the pool when the agent is gone.
//
// Whose lease it is comes from the CONNECTION, never from the arguments: the
// calling agent, which the gateway knows from the agent's launch. Anything
// else calling is refused, because a lease nobody owns is returned the moment
// the cleanup next looks.
