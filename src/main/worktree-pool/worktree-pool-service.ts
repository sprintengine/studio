/**
 * The pool of reusable agent worktrees.
 *
 * A fresh worktree costs a checkout and, far more, whatever the agent then
 * spends rebuilding the ignored files a tree needs before its tests pass
 * (`node_modules`, a virtual environment, build caches). The pool keeps the
 * worktrees agents are done with instead of deleting them, and hands one to the
 * next agent after moving it to the default branch. The ignored files survive
 * the move, so the next agent's install is an incremental one, or none.
 *
 * ## What it costs while nobody uses it
 *
 * Nothing but disk (owner ruling 2026-09-24). No refresh, no fetch and no
 * install runs in the background. Every git step happens because someone asked
 * for a worktree (a lease) or a sweep found one nobody uses (a return), and a
 * slot's size is measured only when Settings ▸ Worktrees asks or, with a disk
 * limit set, when the slot comes back. The
 * pool itself never installs dependencies. A project that opted in
 * (Settings ▸ Worktrees) has its install run on the lease, for the chat or
 * agent that asked and before it gets the worktree, when the lockfile changed
 * (dependency-install.ts); otherwise an agent that needs them runs its own
 * install, which on a reused slot finds most of the work already done.
 *
 * ## Life of a slot
 *
 *   creating → leasing → leased                         (no idle slot to reuse)
 *   idle → leasing → leased                             (fetch, reset to base, branch)
 *   leased → returning → idle                           (clean return)
 *   leased → returning → held                           (work left in it)
 *   idle → evicting → gone                              (over the idle, slot or disk limit)
 *
 * A lease always forks from `origin/<default>` as fetched at that moment (at
 * most once a minute per repository, and never waiting longer than
 * LEASE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS: offline, it forks from what the ref already says).
 *
 * A slot lives at `<repo-parent>/.sprintengine-worktrees/<repo>/pool-NN` and
 * keeps that path for its whole life: virtual environments and build caches
 * record absolute paths and do not survive a move. A leased slot is on
 * `agent/<slug>` and locked with the agent worktree lock
 * (agent-worktree-lock.ts), so git's own `prune` and `remove`, another Studio
 * profile's cleanup and the Worktree manager all leave it alone.
 *
 * ## What the pool never does
 *
 * - It never resets a tree that holds work. Every reset is preceded, in the
 *   same step, by a status read of the slot (untracked files included, ignored
 *   ones not); anything reported makes the slot `held`, and a held slot changes
 *   only when a person picks Commit, Stash, Discard or Keep.
 * - It never recycles a slot something runs in: a live terminal inside the slot
 *   postpones the return.
 * - It never deletes an agent's branch. Returning detaches HEAD; the branch and
 *   its commits stay (the agent worktree cleanup deletes the branch once its
 *   work is on the default branch). A detached HEAD holding commits no ref
 *   reaches is first given a branch of its own.
 * - It never recycles a slot mid-merge, mid-rebase or mid-cherry-pick.
 * - It never runs `clean -x`: ignored files (installed dependencies, build
 *   caches, a copied `.env`) are what makes a reused slot worth having. An
 *   ignored file where the new base adds a tracked one holds the slot instead
 *   of being overwritten.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * Each pool has one mutex, held only across a state transition and its
 * persistence, never across a git step. A slot in a transitional state is not
 * leasable, so two leases never get one slot, and a lease never gets a slot
 * that is being returned or evicted. A second Studio is kept off the same slots
 * by a lock file in the container (pool-store.ts). The worktree registry itself
 * is changed under worktree-registry-lock.ts.
 *
 * ## Crash recovery
 *
 * A slot's `op` is persisted before each git step and cleared after it. When a
 * pool is first used after a start, a slot found with an `op` is finished or
 * held, per step (see `recoverPool`), and a `pool-NN` worktree with no record is
 * adopted as held, never reset.
