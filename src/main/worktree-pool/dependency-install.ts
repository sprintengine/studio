/**
 * A leased pool worktree installs its dependencies when its lockfile changed
 * since it last did (owner ruling 2026-10-06, revising "no installs, ever").
 *
 * The pool itself stays install-free: it resets a slot and hands it out, and
 * this runs after, in the one place every agent worktree is made
 * (`createAgentWorktreeFromPool` in git.ts), so New chat, the tab strip's
 * worktree spawn, `agent.launch` and scheduled runs all wait for it the same
 * way. The agent starts once it ends, whether or not it worked: a failed
 * install is reported, never a reason to withhold the chat.
 *
 * Off unless the project opted in, because an install runs the repository's
 * own scripts (`postinstall` and the like) with the person's rights.
 *
 * What a slot last installed is recorded in its git admin directory
 * (`.git/worktrees/<slot>/`), not in the pool's record and not in the
 * worktree: `clean -fd` and "Clear ignored files" never reach it, git ignores
 * a file it does not know there, and it lives exactly as long as the slot is
 * registered — a slot removed and made again starts with no record, as it
 * starts with no `node_modules`. The record is a fingerprint of everything the
 * install's result depends on (`installFingerprint`); it is cleared before an
 * install starts and written only when one succeeds, so an install that
 * failed, timed out, was cancelled or was killed by the app quitting runs
 * again at the next lease.
