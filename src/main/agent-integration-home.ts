// The app-owned launch home: the plugin directories this app hands a CLI at
// launch time, instead of writing its skills, its MCP bridge and its
// agent-state hook into the user's repository.
//
// Why it exists. Everything this app shipped a workspace used to live in that
// workspace — `.sprintengine/studio-plugin`, `.sprintengine/hooks/agent-state.mjs`,
// hook entries in `.claude/settings.local.json`, the MCP gateway in `.mcp.json`,
// skill copies under `.claude/skills`. docs/agent-launch-isolation.md lists every
// one of them, which CLI reads it, and which have moved here. That has three costs a person
// actually feels: the files show up in their repository, a colleague who never
// ran this app inherits hook commands naming paths that do not exist on their
// machine, and anyone running `claude` in that checkout OUTSIDE this app gets
// this app's hooks and skills. Handing the CLI a `--plugin-dir` at launch has
// none of them: the copy lives here, the flag applies to that one session, and
// a CLI started any other way sees nothing.
//
// What the directory holds, and why here rather than `~/.sprintengine`. One
// materialised copy of the bundled marketplace per PLUGIN VERSION, under this
// profile's userData directory. Two of the values substituted into it — the
// node binary that runs the MCP bridge, and the bridge script itself — belong
// to the build that wrote them, so the copy cannot be shared across builds; a
// dev build (whose userData is its own `sprintengine-dev-<port>` directory) and a
// packaged build therefore never overwrite each other's, which is exactly the
// collision the shared workspace file had.
//
// The socket is substituted too, but the reporter prefers
// `SPRINTENGINE_AGENT_STATE_SOCKET` from the launch env over the baked value, so a
// copy written by one app instance still reports to the instance that actually
// launched the agent.
