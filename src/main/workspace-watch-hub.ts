/**
 * One OS watcher per watched root, shared by every caller that watches it.
 *
 * The renderer's file tree, the git status hook, the backlog scan and module
 * file watches all watched the same workspace root, each with its own recursive
 * `fs.watch` — so one `npm install` was delivered to main four times over, and
 * every one of those raw events reset a timer on main's event loop. Here the
 * root is watched once and the events are fanned out.
 *
 * Two things happen before anything leaves main:
 *
 * 1. **Churn nobody renders is dropped.** `.git/` (the gitdir watcher in
 *    git-repo-watch.ts reads that, precisely), `node_modules/`, the app's own
 *    `.sprintengine/` sidecar, and build output. An install or a build inside a
 *    watched checkout is thousands of events that would otherwise each wake the
 *    file tree and the git status reader.
 * 2. **A burst becomes a SET of paths, not `path: null`.** The previous
 *    coalescing collapsed any two events inside the window to "something
 *    changed", and the two consumers read that null in opposite ways: the file
 *    tree refreshed on it (so `node_modules` churn refreshed the tree) and the
 *    git status hook ignored it (so a real edit that arrived in the same burst
 *    as anything else was silently dropped). With the paths kept, each consumer
 *    decides on what actually changed.
 *
 * A subscriber that needs the dropped directories (a module watching a file
 * under `.sprintengine/`) asks for `includeIgnored`, and still shares the one
 * watcher.
