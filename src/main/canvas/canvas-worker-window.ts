// The canvas worker's window: a renderer that exists only to hold a DOM.
//
// It is the third HTML entry in the app (after the shell and the splash) and it
// is loaded exactly the way `splash-window.ts` loads its own — dev serves it
// beside the shell, a packaged build has it next to `index.html` in the
// renderer output.
//
// Everything here is about the window NOT being an app window:
//
//   * `show: false` and never shown, `focusable: false`, `skipTaskbar: true`:
//     it is not in the Dock, the taskbar, the window switcher or the tab order,
//     and it cannot take focus from the person mid-sentence.
//   * It is not registered with `window-factory`'s workspace set, so it is not
//     a host the embedded browser adopts guests from and it receives none of
//     the pushes that go to workspace windows.
//   * It closes itself when it is the LAST window left. Electron only emits
//     `window-all-closed` when no BrowserWindow remains, and the app's quit,
//     tray and `activate` paths all hang off that event — a hidden window that
//     outlived the person's last real one would read as an app that refuses to
//     quit and will not reopen.
//
// The ready handshake is the worker's own word that its editor instance has
// mounted and its fonts are loaded; requests sent before that would be dropped
// by a page with no listener yet.
