// The half of the canvas worker that is not a window.
//
// Four of the five canvas operations need a DOM, so they run in a renderer
// nobody sees. What talks to that renderer is a request/response protocol with
// a deadline, a restart and a queue — rules that have nothing to do with
// Electron, and that are worth being able to prove without starting one. So the
// window lives in `canvas-worker-window.ts` behind the `CanvasWorkerTransport`
// interface below, and everything that can go wrong is decided here.
//
// Correlation is on `requestId` alone, and the rule is the same one
// `ipc/dock-diff.ts` arrived at: an answer that is late is not an answer. A
// worker that replies after its deadline finds its request already settled and
// is dropped, rather than being handed to whoever asked next.
