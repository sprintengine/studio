// Which repository a folder is a clone of, and — the part this suite is for —
// whether the question was ANSWERED (one-colour-per-project, 2026-09-09).
//
// The reader always answered a bare `RepositoryIdentity | null`, which made
// "asked, and this folder has no remote" indistinguishable from "could not
// ask": a 3s timeout on a spun-down volume, or git throwing. That is fine for
// grouping, where either way the folder groups by its path, and wrong for the
// project colour, which WRITES the answer down — a folder on a sleeping disk
// would be given a hue under its path key now and a second one under its
// repository key the next time the disk was awake, so one project would wear
// two of the six colours. `settled` is what the renderer waits on, so it is
// worth a suite of its own.
//
// The git calls are injected. The alternative is a real repository per case,
// which cannot produce the failure modes that matter here (a read that throws,
// a read served from the hold) without a great deal of ceremony.
