/**
 * AgentLaunchService — composing an agent launch is a main-process capability
 * (MC-2159).
 *
 * The spawn mechanics were already main-owned (`terminal-launch.ts` renders the
 * argv and env; the runtime's spawn handler takes the whole payload as data).
 * What lived in the renderer was the DECISION layer: which CLI when the caller
 * named none, which permission preset, how a connector resolves, what the agent
 * is called, and how a specialist directive is wrapped. It lived in a React
 * hook, so `agent.launch`, `backlog.work`, and agent-backed `automation.run`
 * actions all failed headless — not because they needed a window, but because
 * the composition did.
 *
 * This service is that layer, with every input injected:
 *
 * - **CLI + permission defaults** come from the main-owned launch settings store
 *   (MC-2154), which the renderer pushes on change and main reads synchronously,
 *   so a headless launch uses the user's real defaults instead of guessing.
 * - **Connector resolution** is the shared rule (`src/shared/connector-launch.ts`)
 *   over main's own MCP catalog — the same answer the connector chat gets.
 * - **Specialist prompt composition** is the shared builder
 *   (`src/shared/specialists/specialist-actions.ts`), so a specialist launched
 *   by an automation fetches its Soul exactly like one launched by a person.
 * - **The spawn** is the terminal runtime's own handler. Nothing here writes to
 *   a pty or knows what Electron is.
 *
 * ## The renderer's remaining half
 *
 * Main mints the terminal session id and spawns; the launched record rides back
 * on the session snapshot as {@link AgentLaunchRecord}. The renderer projects
 * live sessions into `AgentState` records and reveals their tabs
 * (`projectLaunchedAgentSessions`), so the FlexLayout tab is a VIEW of main's
 * session list. A `TerminalView` mounting on a projected agent calls
 * `terminalSpawn` with the session id main already used, which the runtime
 * answers by reattaching and replaying the retained scrollback — which is why a
 * window opened long after a headless launch shows the terminal with its
 * history, and why no launch is ever performed twice.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * Dispatch per transport (a conversation-runtime session for non-PTY agents) is
 * named by the item as the second half. Every caller today asks for a terminal
 * agent, and the `transport` field below is the seam that half plugs into: it is
 * resolved here, in one place, rather than each caller assuming a pty.
