// Authoritative agent state — pure core (no Electron deps, fully unit-testable)
//
// This module owns three concerns that need no main-process runtime:
//   1. Resolving a reporter frame against a CLI's manifest-declared
//      `agentStateSpec` (event → AgentPhase, discriminators, turn-end flags).
//      The per-CLI vocabulary is DATA on each plugin manifest, never code here.
//   2. The AgentPhase → legacy SessionActivity bridge (so existing consumers
//      keep working untouched while the richer phase rides alongside).
//   3. Validating an untrusted reporter frame and (un)installing the reporter
//      into a workspace, dispatched by the spec's registration kind.
//
// The Electron-bound half (the socket listener + session resolution + renderer
// broadcast + launch-time install) lives in a sibling service module so this
// stays importable from a plain Node test harness.
// =============================================================================

export const AGENT_STATE_HOOK_TAG = 'sprintengine-agent-state'

// Where the reporter script is copied inside a workspace. The reporter also
// honours a SPRINTENGINE_AGENT_STATE_SOCKET env fallback (see the .mjs), but the
// install always passes the socket via --socket, so it is not referenced here.
export const AGENT_STATE_HOOK_SCRIPT_REL = join('.sprintengine', 'hooks', 'agent-state.mjs')

// =============================================================================
// Frame resolution against a manifest agentStateSpec
//
// The reporter forwards the RAW event name (plus the payload discriminator
// fields the specs consult — today only `notificationType`); the mapping to a
// phase happens HERE, from the resolving plugin's manifest data. That keeps
// every CLI's vocabulary in one authored, validated place and out of the
// reporter scripts, which used to carry a second copy that had to be mirrored
// by hand.
//
// Turn-end and turn-failure ride the same table as per-event flags, raw-event-
// level deliberately: several events share a phase (Claude's Stop and
// SubagentStop both map to `idle`; OpenCode's session.error maps to `idle` like
// its session.idle), so only the event name can tell a session's turn end from
// a subagent's, or a crash from a clean finish. Consumers read the computed
// flags off the phase event, never event names.

/**
 * Fold an event name to the form event matching compares on: lower-cased with
 * `_` and `-` removed, so `PreToolUse`, `pre_tool_use`, `pre-tool-use` and
 * `preToolUse` are all one event.
 *
 * Why this exists: a CLI's CONFIG spelling and its PAYLOAD spelling
 * need not agree. Grok Build reads `PreToolUse` in `.grok/hooks/*.json` (and
 * accepts the snake_case and Cursor camelCase spellings there too) but stamps
 * the payload `"hookEventName": "pre_tool_use"`. Matching the manifest's
 * PascalCase against that frame exactly dropped EVERY Grok frame, so a Grok
 * agent never left `starting` until the stall watch flagged it.
 *
 * One fold, not per-event aliases: an alias table is a second vocabulary to
 * maintain per CLI, and it is silently wrong for the next event nobody listed.
 * The manifests keep the CLI's own written spelling (Grok/Claude PascalCase,
 * Cursor camelCase, OpenCode dotted) — this only decides EQUALITY.
 *
 * `.` is deliberately NOT stripped: OpenCode's `session.idle` /
 * `tool.execute.before` are structured names whose dots separate real segments,
 * and folding them would collapse distinct events.
 *
 * Collision safety is a per-manifest property (two entries in ONE spec must not
 * fold together); every shipped manifest is checked by test, since the first
 * canonical match wins.

// is real.
//
// A held turn end lands on `tool_use` — the session is inside a tool whose
// result has not come back — with `turnEnd` false, so no consumer finalizes.
// A FAILED turn end is never held: an aborted or crashed turn is over whatever
// was outstanding. The count clamps at zero (a stop with nothing open is a
// subagent that started before the reporter was installed) and the runtime
// resets it on a session start (a fresh process owns nothing from its previous

 * zero) and moves no phase — see `keepsTurnEnd` — and when the start lands
 * after it, stamped earlier, it is not stale to the stale-frame guard, because
 * that stop never moved the phase's timestamp. Counted, it would open work that
 * nothing is left to close, and the next `Stop` would be held as working until
 * the stall watch gave up on it. So the time of each stop that closed nothing
 * is kept, and a start stamped at or before it is taken as already closed.
 *
 * Only a start stamped within a delivery window of that stop is taken: a

// sidebar's working clock, finalizes an automation run, and makes the agent
// reclaimable. Two kinds of frame used to undo it, and neither is the agent
// working again.
//
// 1. A background stop that closes nothing. Claude Code runs a helper agent of
//    its own after a turn and reports it with a `SubagentStop` (empty
//    `agent_type`) and no `SubagentStart`, four to five seconds after `Stop`
//    (observed on CLI 2.1.281, 2026-09-24; not after every turn). Mapped as
//    "the parent resumes", it put a finished session back on `thinking`, where
//    it stayed until the stall watch found it 90 seconds later. A stop only means the parent resumes when it closes
//    work the count holds open — that case is the held Stop above, and it
//    still works — so one that closes nothing moves no phase at all.
//
// 2. A straggler from the turn that just ended. Every hook is its own reporter
//    process, stamped when it has started up rather than when the CLI fired
//    it, and a delivery retries for up to two seconds; a `PostToolUse` spawned
//    before `Stop` can therefore carry a later timestamp and land after it. The
//    stale-frame guard cannot see that, so a short window after a turn end
//    admits only a frame that OPENS work: the person's prompt, a session
//    start, a background agent starting.
//
// The window is short on purpose. Claude Code re-invokes the model without a
// prompt (a background task finishing, a scheduled wakeup), and those turns
// report tool calls well after the Stop they follow; they must still read as
// working. And the window applies only to a CLI whose manifest reports the
// person's prompt, because only there does a real new turn have an opener to
// be recognized by — OpenCode starts one with `message.updated`, and holding
// that back would hide a turn rather than a straggler.

// context window is gone. Claude Code puts that number (and the session's cost,
// line counts, model and name) on stdin of the `statusLine` command, refreshed
// after every assistant message, after a /compact, on a permission-mode change
// and on a rate-limit reset. So the app makes itself that command — the
// forwarder script beside the reporter — and turns each refresh into a frame.
//
// A person may already have a status line, and taking it away to read a number
// would be a straight theft of their terminal. So install WRAPS: their command
// is base64'd into `--wrap`, the forwarder runs it with the same stdin bytes and
// passes its stdout and exit code through, and the object we displaced is kept
// verbatim under `_sprintengineWrapped` so uninstall can put it back exactly.
//
// Same `_sprintengine` discipline as the hooks: our entry is recognizable, ours
// alone is ever replaced, every other key in the file is preserved, and install
// is idempotent (a second install unwraps our own entry rather than wrapping
// itself). Serialization is the caller's, and it is the SAME per-target-file

// SPELLING. Event names are written here EXACTLY as the manifest
// spells them — no folding on the way out. Config spelling is a property of the
// registration kind and is not the same question as frame matching
// (canonicalEventName), which is deliberately spelling-blind because a CLI's
// payload spelling need not match its config spelling.
//
// Verified against grok 1.0.13 on 2026-09-09 by writing candidate
// `.grok/hooks/*.json` files and counting what `grok inspect` loaded (its
// loader filters unknown event names — a file of invented names loads 0):
//   PascalCase  `PreToolUse`    loaded (all 15 events)  <- what we emit
//   snake_case  `pre_tool_use`  loaded
//   camelCase   `preToolUse`    loaded (documented Cursor-compat alias)
//   kebab-case  `pre-tool-use`  SKIPPED
//   SCREAMING   `PRETOOLUSE`    SKIPPED
// So Grok accepts a fixed alias SET, not arbitrary case folding, and the
// manifest's PascalCase is inside it: this emitter needs no per-kind rule
// today. If a future owned-json CLI reads only one spelling, convert HERE
// (keyed off the registration kind) and leave both the manifest's written form

// TEMPLATE named by the manifest's registration. It subscribes to the CLI's
// events itself and emits the same socket frames; the manifest's `events` table
// remains the canonical event→phase mapping the main process applies — the
// template's internal mapping only decides which events it reports and dedups
// on (frame `phase` is consulted solely when no spec entry resolves the event).
//
// A plugin can't take a --socket arg, so the live socket path is baked into the
// file at install time (token substitution); the plugin also honours
// SPRINTENGINE_AGENT_STATE_SOCKET as a fallback. Note the OpenCode dest extension
// is .js while the bundled template ships as .mjs (the packaging filter is
// **/*.mjs; OpenCode's loader picks up .js/.ts but not .mjs, verified against
// opencode v1.17.11) — the manifest declares both names, so the rename is data.
// =============================================================================
