 *   The chat would keep showing a history the model no longer has, and every
 *   "Edit from here" point would name the conversation it left.
 * - `resume`, `exit`, `quit`: leave the conversation the chat follows. Claude
 *   Code keeps them out of a headless list today; listed in case it stops.
 * - `model`, `effort`: the composer's model and effort controls own these. Set
 *   inside the CLI they would change behind a picker that still names the old
 *   value, and the next respawn would put the picker's value back.
 * - `workflow-launch-exec`, and any name starting with `_`: the CLI's plumbing
 *   for sessions a server launched, not something a person types.
 * The terminal-bound commands are dropped too (see `TERMINAL_ONLY`), as are
 * rows that only say where a command went (`(removed) …`, `Renamed to /…`).
