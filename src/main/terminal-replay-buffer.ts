/**
 * The retained pty stream of one terminal, held as UTF-8 bytes.
 *
 * It used to be an array of the JS strings node-pty handed over. Agent CLIs
 * paint with box-drawing characters and braille spinners, which V8 can only
 * store as two-byte strings, so 2.5 MB of retained UTF-8 cost up to 5 MB of JS
 * heap per terminal — and every one of those strings was a separate heap
 * object the collector had to walk. Bytes cost one byte each and live outside
 * the V8 heap.
 *
 * Small writes are copied into blocks of {@link REPLAY_BLOCK_BYTES} rather than
 * kept one Buffer each. Node slices a small `Buffer.from(string)` out of a
 * shared 8 KB pool, so retaining thousands of 40-byte ConPTY chunks that way
 * would pin thousands of 8 KB slabs; a block of our own is allocated outside
 * the pool and filled to the brim.
 *
 * Offsets are STREAM offsets: `endOffset` counts every byte ever appended, and
 * `startOffset` is where the retained window begins. A reader that remembers
 * how far it got (the renderer's delivered offset, see terminal-output-buffer)
 * can ask for exactly what it missed, and learns it has fallen off the head
 * when {@link TerminalReplayBuffer.readFrom} returns null.
