/**
 * ConversationLaunchService — starting a chat agent is a main-process
 * capability, as starting a terminal agent is (`agent-launch-service.ts`).
 *
 * A window starts a chat by adding a conversation-runtime agent to its store
 * and letting the chat view start the session and send the first message. That
 * needs a window showing the chat. A paired machine asking this one to start a
 * chat over the tailnet has no window here to lean on, so the same three steps
 * run in main:
 *
 * 1. The agent record is written to the workspace registry, so every window
 *    here lists the chat and a later-opened one shows it with its history.
 * 2. The conversation session is started, on the CLI's chat provider.
 * 3. The prompt is sent as the chat's first message. The send is NOT awaited:
 *    the runtime answers a send when the whole turn has finished, and the
 *    caller is a person waiting on a pane that follows the turn live.
 *
 * A session that cannot start takes its record back out, so a refused launch
 * never leaves a chat nobody can open.
 *
 * A workspace here is one chat, and its name is the chat's title. So a caller
 * that means "a new chat in this project" — a phone's or a paired machine's
 * New chat, which names a project by one of the workspaces in its folder —
 * asks for `newChat`: the chat is then born in a workspace of its own, in that
 * workspace's folder, instead of joining the chat that workspace already is.
 * A refused start then takes that whole workspace back out.
 *
 * The same three steps start every chat main starts for someone else: a module's
 * `create`, and an automation run's agent. Those callers add what a window's
 * New chat also carries — skills installed before the session starts and
 * attached to the first message, pictures on it — plus what only they need: the
 * module that owns the chat, and a run worktree the chat works in instead of
 * the workspace checkout.
