/**
 * What a workspace's row reports as changed
 * (the-diff-an-agent-made / branch-scoped-row-diff).
 *
 * The reading is the branch the agent's checkout is on:
 * `merge-base(HEAD, <trunk>) → working tree`. Whatever the person already had
 * committed on the trunk sits on both sides of that base and never enters the
 * number, and — the property the checkpoint model could not have — a pull, a
 * merge or a commit landing under the agent moves HEAD and the base together, so
 * ordinary repo movement is invisible here by construction.
 *
 * `scope` is the honesty contract, not a debug field. It says how much the
 * caller is entitled to claim, and the row's tooltip and spoken label are
 * derived from it:
 *
 * - `worktree` — a LINKED worktree, so nothing else writes into this checkout.
 *   The numbers are this chat's work.
 * - `branch`   — a shared checkout on a branch that is NOT the trunk, carrying
 *   commits the trunk does not. The numbers are the BRANCH's work, which may
 *   include commits a person or another chat made on it.
 * - `folder`   — a shared checkout with no branch work to attribute: on the
 *   trunk itself, detached, or with no trunk to compare against. All that can
 *   honestly be said is what is uncommitted.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to enforce, inherited from the reading it replaced
 * and restored after a review found it missing: **never report a confident zero
 * for a span we could not read.** The row draws nothing for zeros, so an
 * unreadable span reported as zero would silently claim "this agent changed
 * nothing" about work it merely failed to measure.
