/**
 * Copy a file or a directory tree, sharing blocks with the source wherever the
 * filesystem can.
 *
 * What `.worktreeinclude` names is usually heavy and rarely edited — a
 * dependency folder, a build cache, a local env file — and a new worktree that
 * gets a full byte copy of a gigabyte of `node_modules` pays seconds and the
 * gigabyte. `COPYFILE_FICLONE` asks for a copy-on-write clone: APFS clonefile,
 * a reflink on Btrfs or XFS, a block clone on a ReFS Dev Drive. The clone costs
 * a metadata write and no data until either side is changed. Where the
 * filesystem cannot clone, Node itself falls back to an ordinary copy under
 * the same flag, and an error from the clone attempt is retried as a plain
 * copy here as well, so the only outcome that differs by filesystem is speed.
 *
 * Symlinks are recreated as symlinks, not followed: a `node_modules/.bin` full
 * of links must stay links, and following one out of the tree would copy
 * whatever it points at. Anything that is neither a regular file, a directory
 * nor a symlink (a FIFO, a socket a dev server left behind) is not copied.
