// The pane pop-out's relay, as a protocol (shared/ipc/pane-popout.ts has the
// three parties and the messages).
//
// It lives apart from its Electron glue (`ipc/pane-popout-ipc.ts`) for the same
// reason `ipc/dock-diff.ts` does: the rules are here, and a unit test cannot
// load `electron`. Nothing in this file knows what a BrowserWindow is. A peer is
// something that can be sent to, and recognised again when a message comes
// FROM it.
//
// What it is careful about:
//
//   1. **Only the owner speaks for the tabs.** A push, a focus or a close is
//      taken from the window that opened the pop-out and from nobody else; an
//      action is taken from the pop-out window itself. A pop-out id alone is
//      not a credential — any renderer could name one.
//   2. **Main interprets nothing.** A push is held as it came so a window that
//      boots after it can ask for it, and an action is handed on as it came.
//      The owner's pane slice normalizes everything it is sent; checking tab
//      records twice, in two places, is how the two would come to disagree.
//      The one question main asks of a push is which terminals it holds
//      (`mayAttachTerminal`): a pty's output goes to one window.
//   3. **A pop-out never outlives its owner.** The owner's store is the only
//      record of which tabs are out; a reloaded or closed owner has lost it, so
//      the windows it opened are closed rather than left showing tabs nobody
//      can take back (`ownerGone`).
