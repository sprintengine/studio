// Installing a plugin into a workspace (backlog/2026-09-05-plugin-sources.md,
// "What install means, per kind and per harness"), corrected by
// backlog/2026-09-06-a-github-marketplace-plugin-installs-nothing-for-claude-code.md.
//
// A plugin is a catalogue. `skillIds` / `mcpServerIds` pick the items this
// call copies; omitting both is the remaining all-in path (a single-skill
// plugin with nothing else to choose). Every harness is served the same way:
// what this app can copy, it copies.
//
//  1. **The chosen skills are copied.** Through the existing skill installer, into
//     every harness's skill directory, each copy carrying a provenance marker
//     so Sync owns it afterwards. Claude Code included — see below.
//  2. **The chosen MCP servers are handed back.** MCP settings live in the renderer
//     store and sync into each CLI's own config from there (the workspace's
//     `.mcp.json` for Claude Code); the install returns the configs and the
//     surface adds them.
//  3. **The plugin's own directory is copied when a chosen server needs it.** A
//     server declared as `bun run --cwd ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} … start` cannot
//     start unless those files are on disk and that variable means something,
//     and only Claude Code's own loader sets it. So the plugin root lands under
//     `.sprintengine/claude-plugins/<id>` and the variable is resolved to where it
//     landed (plugin-directory.ts, shared/mcp/plugin-root.ts). A plugin whose
//     servers name no such directory copies nothing extra.
//  4. **Commands, agents, hooks and language servers are not installed.** They
//     are Claude Code's own formats and this app has no loader for them; the
//     outcome and the pane say so rather than implying they landed.
//
// Claude Code used to be the exception: a plugin from a GitHub marketplace was
// "enabled natively" by writing `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins`
// into `<workspace>/.claude/settings.json`, and nothing was copied for it.
// Measured twice, independently, against Claude Code 2.1.263 on 2026-09-06:
// those two keys load NOTHING on their own. A `github` marketplace also needs
// `claude plugin marketplace add` AND `claude plugin install` — two writes to
// another product's user-global state, which this app will not make behind a
// person's back. So the keys stopped being the install (owner ruling,
// 2026-09-06) and became an extra: still written on an all-in install where
// they are harmless, so a person who runs `claude plugin install` themselves
// gets the native load too, and nothing here depends on them. A one-item
// install does not write them — naming the plugin would invite a native load
// of every skill it ships. A settings file that cannot be written is a warning
// beside a completed all-in install, never a failed one.
//
// The settings file is merged, never replaced: only the two keys are touched,
// only the entries this install adds, and uninstall removes only those.
