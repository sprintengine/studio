// One run of a scheduled agent: what New chat does when someone presses Enter,

// project (on its machine, in a fresh worktree when one was asked for), a chat
// agent in it, and the prompt as its first message. The chat is then an
// ordinary chat — it opens, works and settles like any other — with one field
// more: the id of the scheduled agent that started it, written on its
// workspace. That is what the sidebar marks a run's chat by, what the schedule's
// editor lists its runs by, and what keeps a run from starting while the one
// before it is still working.
