// When scheduled agents run. One timer, armed for the soonest next run across
// every scheduled agent, re-armed after each run and whenever the list changes.
//
// Missed runs: a schedule that came round while the app was closed is not
// replayed — the next run is counted from start-up. One that came round while
// the computer slept, with the app open, runs once on waking: the timer was
// armed for it, and a run late by the length of a nap is still the run the
// person asked for. Several missed times of the same schedule run once, not
// once each.
//
// Runs never overlap. A run is skipped, scheduled or asked for, while the
// schedule's previous run is still starting or its chat is still working: a
// schedule that comes round faster than its runs finish would otherwise stack
// chats doing the same job on the same checkout. A skipped time is not queued —
// the next one counts on from it, as a missed one does.
//
// A one-time schedule is the exception to "missed runs are not replayed": it
// is one message the person asked to have sent, and late is closer to that
// than never, so one whose time passed while the app was closed runs once the
// app is open. It runs once — the scheduler never arms it again after firing.
