// The app-wide CLI version check, per machine: this one, and each WSL

// share the npm cache and the enabled flag the Settings switch mirrors into
// main.
//
// Two different questions, asked at two different rates:
//
//   Which CLIs are installed, at which version   detection: a process per
//                                                installed CLI here, one helper
//                                                request per WSL machine
//   What is the newest release of each of those   one registry GET per package
//
// Detection runs at startup (`detectCliMachines`), again only when the person
// presses Re-check (`detect: true`), and for one CLI after the app installed or
// updated it (`noteCliDetected`). The hourly poll asks only the second
// question: it compares the installed versions detection last found
// (`knownCliAvailability`) against the registry, so it starts no process, never
// starts a stopped WSL distribution, and never asks about a CLI that is not
// installed.
