// Part of the IPC contract: the workspace pane, or one of its tabs, popped out
// into a window of its own. ../electron-api.ts re-exports everything here.
//
// Three parties. The OWNER is the workspace window whose pane the tabs belong
// to; its store is the only record of them, so it stays the source of truth
// for as long as they are out. The POP-OUT is an aux window (`?aux=pane`) that
// mounts their bodies and draws their strip. MAIN sits between the two: it
// opens and closes the window, remembers which window owns which pop-out, and
// relays — it never interprets a tab.
//
// The owner pushes what the pop-out should show (`PanePopOutState`) whenever
// those tabs change; the pop-out sends back what the person did there
// (`PanePopOutAction`) and renders the owner's answer. When the pop-out window
// closes, the owner is told, and its tabs dock back into the pane.
