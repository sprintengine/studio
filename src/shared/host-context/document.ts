/**
 * Host context: everything the host application wants the agent to know that is
 * NOT the user's request.
 *
 * Before this module, the two things we had to say — a design system is attached
 * at `design-system/`, and this project has a Knowledge Graph — were appended to
 * the user's first message by the renderer. That has three faults the owner
 * called out (2026-09-07): the model reads host context as part of the request,
 * resume skips it entirely, and the headless launch path only ever appended half
 * of it. So the two sentences become ONE document, built once in main, and the
 * CLI manifest says how it is delivered (`contextInjection`).
 *
 * This module is the document, and nothing else: pure, no I/O, no Electron. It
 * deliberately reuses `DESIGN_SYSTEM_ATTACHED_PROMPT_LINE` and
 * `knowledgeLaunchContext` verbatim — the agent's instructions do not change,
 * only the channel they arrive on.
 *
 * Every delivery mode marks the boundary. Even on a flag or an env var the
 * document opens with {@link HOST_CONTEXT_BOUNDARY_LINE}, because a system
 * prompt the model cannot tell apart from the user's words is the same defect in
 * a quieter place. In the prompt fallback the document is additionally wrapped
 * in `<host-context>` tags and placed AFTER the prompt: the UserPromptSubmit
 * hook titles the workspace from the first words it sees, and those have to be
 * the person's request, not the host's.
