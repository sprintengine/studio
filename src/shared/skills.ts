// ── Update-check cadence (MC-2519, owner ruling 2026-09-08) ──────────────────
//
// Over git the cadence is hourly for everyone (git-transport ruling, owner
// 2026-09-08): a head check is `git ls-remote`, which GitHub's REST limit does
// not count at all, so there is nothing for a token to buy and nothing to
// ration. The rest of this block is the API fallback — the machine with no git
// — where the arithmetic below still holds.
//
// On the API path, how often a repository source is asked for its head depends
// on whether a GitHub token is configured. Anonymous GitHub allows 60 requests
// an hour for the whole machine, shared with every other read the app makes and
// with anything else on the same IP; a source checked hourly spends 24 of those
// a day on a question whose answer changes far less often, and a person with
// several sources can exhaust the budget on update checks alone and then find a
// scan or an install refused. With a token the limit is 5,000 an hour, where
// hourly costs nothing.
//
// The window is enforced per source in `src/main/skills/source-updates.ts`, so
// it holds for every caller — the scheduled check and a manual "Check now"
// alike. The sentences live here because Settings and the Extensions door both
// say them, and neither can import main.
