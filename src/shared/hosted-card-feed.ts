// The hosted card feed: `cards-feed.json` at the root of the public
// sprintengine/studio-releases repo, built by CI from the one-directory-per-card
// repository, fetched raw by every running studio and rendered as the Extensions
// home page. It is how a card reaches every install without an app release —
// the same mechanism the model feed already proved
// (backlog/2026-09-06-the-card-feed-is-a-hosted-file.md, item 2465).
//
// A card travels as data and never as code. It carries copy, the *name* of an
// artwork this build already ships, and an ordered list of actions drawn from a
// closed vocabulary of verbs the studio already implements. A card may name an
// action; it may not bring one. That is why there is no exec verb, no verb that
// writes a file, and no field anywhere below that holds a URL.
//
// **What a press of `Go` can actually cause is written down**, because the
// composition is larger than any one verb and because nothing but our own CI
// and our own authorship stands in front of it (R4a, owner, 2026-09-06):
// `CARD_CLONE_OWNERS` below. Read its note before you widen
// anything below — it also carries the list of conditions under which R4a must
// be revisited rather than inherited. This file used to say the blast radius of
// a hostile feed was "the one the plugin catalogue already has"; that is true
// about the ARTEFACT and false about the ceremony, since the plugin catalogue
// has a person choosing to install and a card deliberately does not.
//
// Node-free on purpose: `src/shared` cannot import `src/main` (TS6307). The
// fetcher, cache, and seed live in src/main/hosted-feed/card-feed-client.ts.
//
// The schema is a permanent contract: builds that are years old will keep
// reading it. Add fields; never remove or repurpose one. A body whose
// `schemaVersion` is not one this build knows is rejected whole and the client
// keeps its last good copy — but a single malformed card is dropped and
// counted, because one bad row must never blank the home page.

// `create.automation` and `design.import` named nothing, and the four that

// attachment list where the composer keeps two, and `open.surface` a

  //
  // It carries no `source` for the reason `install.plugin` carries one: there
  // is exactly one registry, it ships with the app, and a card that could name
  // another would be a card choosing where this machine's code comes from.
  //
  // A module is code that runs in-process, so the executor honours this verb
  // ONLY for a `verified` entry — signed by a publisher in
  // `trusted-publishers.json`. Everything else needs the trust prompt, which is
  // a disclosure a person reads and answers; R4's "Go goes" removes the card's
  // own ceremony and does not repeal somebody else's gate (the same rule
  // `require.cli` follows). Such a card is refused by name, pointing at
  // Extensions → Plugins where the disclosure lives.

  // skills by directory name — a `WorkspaceSkill.id`; `mcpServers` names
  // MCP server ids. `send` is required rather than optional: R4 is "Go goes", and
  // an unstated `send` leaves the reader guessing whether the card meant to park

  // the card's servers reach the chat by already being in the workspace's

/**
 * The GitHub owners a card may clone from — the one rule in this file that
 * names us rather than the schema, and the one defence a card feed has that
 * does not run in CI.
 *
 * `clone.repo` is the outlier among the verbs. Every other id a card carries is
 * resolved against something this build already holds: a CLI against the
 * registered agent-CLI plugin ids, a server against the workspace's own MCP
 * settings,
 * a skill or a plugin against that source's own scan, a view against the four
 * `CARD_SURFACE_VIEWS`. A repository was resolved against nothing. The only
 * test applied to it was its SHAPE, and `owner/name` is a shape every public
 * repository on GitHub has — so `run-card.ts`'s claim that "every id is
 * resolved against something this app already holds" had two exceptions, not
 * one: that file already qualifies itself for `open.chat`'s prompt, and this
 * was the other.
 *
 * What that bought a card is the largest step in the chain a single press can
 * execute. A clone becomes the workspace every later action installs into AND
 * the workspace the chat opens in, and that chat launches on the person's
 * remembered permission preset, whose app-wide default is `bypass`
 * (`DEFAULT_AGENT_SPAWN_PERMISSION_PRESET`, owner, 2026-07-26). A repository we
 * did not publish carries `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json` and agent
 * definitions that the harness reads when it starts — so an unbounded
 * `clone.repo` was a way to put somebody else's instructions in front of an
 * agent running without permission checks, from one press of a button and with
 * no dialog anywhere on the path, which is exactly what R4a rules there must
 * not be.
 *
 * `scripts/check-card-feed-seed.mjs` has refused a non-`sprintengine` clone in
 * the bundled seed since it was written, and said in its own comment that "a
 * card can name any public repository once the feed is hosted". That asymmetry
 * is closed here rather than merely stated (2026-09-06,
 * backlog/2026-09-06-the-only-gate-is-our-own-ci.md), because the seed gate is
 * CI and CI never reads the hosted file: `check-card-feed-seed.mjs` opens
 * `resources/cards-feed.json` and nothing else, so every rule it enforces stops
 * at the artefact that ships in the installer. This rule ships INSIDE the app,
 * which is what makes it hold for the hosted feed too — at both boundaries
 * `parseCardAction` is called from, the feed parse in main and the `cards:run`
 * re-parse in `src/main/ipc/cards-ipc.ts`.
 *
 * The cost, stated so the next person does not discover it: widening this list
 * is an app release, and until every build in the field has it, a card cloning
 * the new owner is dropped — silently, because R6 says the page never
 * apologises for its own network. That is the same operational shape as adding
 * a verb, which this schema already lives with, and it is the reason the list is
 * an array rather than a single constant. GitHub owners are case-insensitive,
 * so the comparison is too.

 *
 *  - **One chat, and it goes last.** The chat is the payoff, so it opens onto
 *    tools that are already there; a chat attached to a server that failed to
 *    install is worse than no chat.
 *  - **A clone comes first or not at all.** `clone.repo` moves the workspace
 *    everything after it runs in, so `[install.mcp, clone.repo, open.chat]`
 *    synced a server into the workspace the person was in and then opened the
 *    chat somewhere else entirely — an install nobody asked for in a project
 *    nobody was looking at.
 *  - **A chat may only name servers the card itself installed.** The chat gets
 *    its MCP servers by reading the `.mcp.json` this card just wrote, so a name
 *    nothing installed is a chat that silently opens with no tools; the card
 *    said what it was, and this is what makes that true.
