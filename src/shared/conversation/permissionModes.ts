// What a chat's permission mode answers on the app's side.
//
// Each runtime is told the mode in its own words when its child starts (a
// flag, an approval policy, a rule set), and the ones that can take it over
// their protocol are told again when it changes. That is the first line. This
// is the second: a request that still reaches the app is answered here when the
// mode already answers it, so a mode means the same thing on every runtime and
// from the moment it is chosen, even on a runtime that only takes the change at
// its next turn. A switch mid-reply answers the requests already waiting the
// same way.
//
// It only ever allows. A mode stricter than the one a runtime's child is
// running under cannot be enforced from here for what the child does without
// asking; the provider says so with a notice, and the stricter mode reaches the
// child at its next turn.
