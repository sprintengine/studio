/**
 * The agent-launch settings, which main owns.
 *
 * Every input main needs to compose an agent launch with no window open lives
 * here: the user-configured CLI runtimes, MCP settings, project knowledge
 * roots, the last-selected CLI and the agent-spawn permission presets. Main
 * holds the one authoritative record under userData; a window reads it at
 * boot, writes to it only through partial `update` patches, and follows every
 * change through the `changed` broadcast. A boot with zero windows (the
 * headless scheduler, a mobile-originated launch) spawns with the same record
 * a window shows. docs/launch-settings-ownership.md has the whole picture.
 *
 * Persistence is a versioned record with a monotonic revision and write
 * provenance: a reader can tell a migrated record from a user write, and a
 * subscriber can order writes. Pure data logic only — all fs/clock access
 * lives in `src/main/launch-settings-store.ts`.
