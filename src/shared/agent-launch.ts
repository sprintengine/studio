/**
 * The agent-launch contract main owns.
 *
 * Launching an agent used to be split in two: a React hook decided the CLI,
 * permission preset, connector environment and name, wrote
 * an `AgentState`, and left the actual spawn to whichever `TerminalView` mounted
 * afterwards. Every one of those decisions is data, none of it is presentation —
 * but because it lived in the renderer, `agent.launch`, `backlog.work`, and
 * agent-backed `automation.run` all failed outright when no window was open.
 *
 * The decision layer now lives in `src/main/agent-launch-service.ts`. This
 * module is the vocabulary both sides speak:
 *
 * - {@link AgentLaunchRequest} — what a caller asks for. Identical in shape to
 *   the old `agent.launch` renderer request, so the gateway, the automations
 *   executor, and the plan orchestrators migrate without changing what they send.
 * - {@link AgentLaunchRecord} — what main DECIDED, carried back on the terminal
 *   session snapshot. The renderer projects it into an `AgentState` so the tab
 *   is a view of main's session list rather than the thing that created it.
 *   Its lifetime is the session's: when the pty is gone, so is the record, and
 *   a window opened an hour later projects exactly the sessions still running.
