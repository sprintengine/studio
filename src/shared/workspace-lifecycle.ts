 * as the store knows it. Main's copy of that clock is otherwise refreshed on a
 * coarse cadence, and a restart rebuilds the row from main's record: a
 * keystroke that never reached main would then read as NEWER than the rest
 * decision and wake the row the moment its session was listed. Sending the
