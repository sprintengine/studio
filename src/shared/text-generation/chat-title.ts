Return JSON with exactly one key: title.

Before answering, silently reduce the request to:
- Subject: What system, feature, or problem is this really about?
- Outcome: What does the user ultimately want to understand or change?
- Incidental instructions: What only describes how the agent should do the work?

Title the subject and outcome. Discard incidental instructions.

Editorial rules:
- 3-8 words, fewer than 40 characters.
- Use a compact noun phrase or clear action phrase.
- Capture the umbrella goal when the request lists several symptoms or steps.
- Name the product change, not the mock, plan, report, branch, or PR used to produce it.
- Models, subagents, tools, output formats, and monitoring instructions do not belong in the title unless they are themselves the topic.
- For reviews, name what is being reviewed and the relevant concern. Avoid generic titles such as "Review PR 123" when the message reveals the subject.
- For research, name the question domain rather than the requested research process.
- Do not claim the work is complete.
- Do not copy and truncate the user's message.
- Avoid project names already visible in the UI, quotes, labels, filler, and trailing punctuation.
- Local git history, branch names and commit messages are not the subject unless the user makes them so.
- If a linked PR or issue is the only clue, fall back to the user's stated action plus its number, such as "Take Over PR 8588". This is the one case where a PR or issue number belongs in the title.`
