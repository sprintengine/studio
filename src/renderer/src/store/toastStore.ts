// The transient-report store behind the app's ONE toast region
// (design-system/components/toast — MC: remote-sessions-ux / toast-host-region).
//
// Deliberately not persisted and deliberately tiny: a toast is the answer to
// "did it work?" in one line, and whatever it announces must also be readable
// somewhere persistent — the row's status, the detail pane, the notification
// bell. A person who missed a toast lost nothing they cannot find, so nothing
// here survives a reload.
//
// Auto-dismiss stays the PRIMITIVE's policy (polite tones 5s, warn/error never)
// — the store only holds what is showing and removes what was dismissed.

// A button on a toast. TWO toasts carry these: the CLI-update toast (owner
// ruling 2026-09-04 — "Update available: Codex 0.153.3" with Settings and
// Update), and the app-update toast (owner ruling 2026-09-23 — Later and
// Restart to update). Every other toast stays button-free; the design-system toast
// spec names both consumers.
