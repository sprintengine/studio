// Resuming a paused agent terminal without the view tearing.
//
// A paused (suspended) agent keeps its painted screen: the frozen snapshot is
// replayed into the xterm and stays readable while no process runs. Resuming
// relaunches the CLI under the same session with its own resume flag, and a CLI
// that resumes a conversation re-renders that conversation itself. Claude Code
// `--resume`, for one, prints its banner and the whole transcript inline, into
// the normal screen buffer, starting wherever the cursor happens to be.
//
// Appending that below the snapshot is what put the history on screen twice:
// once as the frozen copy, pushed up into scrollback, and once as the CLI's own
// render underneath it. Painting it chunk by chunk is what made the screen
// visibly empty and refill.
//
// So the relaunched CLI's output is held here, off screen, while the frozen
// view stays up. It is released once the CLI's first frame has landed: some
// visible text has arrived and the stream has then gone quiet for a moment.
// The caller then swaps the frozen view for that frame in one synchronized
// write (`composeResumeSwap`). The scrollback ends up holding the history once,
// as the CLI rendered it, and there is no frame in which the pane is blank.
//
// The timers exist for CLIs that do not behave like that:
//
//   - `firstFrameDeadlineMs` counts from the first byte, for a CLI that asks
//     the terminal something (a cursor-position report, a device-attributes
//     query) and waits for the answer before drawing. Nothing answers a held
//     query, so holding past the CLI's own timeout would break its start-up;
//     the deadline releases the query in time for xterm to answer it.
//   - `maxFrameMs` counts from the first visible text, for a CLI that never
//     goes quiet. The frame is shown by then whether or not it is finished.
//
// An exit releases what was held without swapping: a CLI that died during
// start-up leaves its error under the frozen view, not in place of it.
