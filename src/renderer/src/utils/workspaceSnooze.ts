// Snooze: "not now, ask me again at <time>" (owner ruling, 2026-09-10).
//
// A snoozed chat STOPS RUNNING and comes back on a clock. Its terminals are
// suspended, so it sits exactly as the app's other non-live chats do — no agent
// process, just a row — and when the wake time passes the row simply returns to
// the sidebar. Nothing is relaunched: the person's first keystroke resumes the
// agent under its own session id with `--resume`, the same way returning to a
// paused chat has always worked (owner ruling, 2026-09-10).
//
// Snooze first shipped visibility-only, on the rule that a snooze never touches
// the agent. That rule does not survive here: visibility-only suits a snooze
// whose session lives on a SERVER, where hiding costs nothing, while ours holds
// a live local process — so "hidden" meant a chat you had told to go away was
// the most expensive row in the tree. The suspend lives in
// `components/workspace/workspaceTerminalTermination.ts`; this module still
// only decides WHEN a row is asleep.
//
// Suspend, not kill, is the whole distinction from Settle — which says the work
// is DONE and drops the ptys outright (owner ruling 2026-09-07). A snoozed chat
// is coming back on a known clock, so its session is kept resumable.
//
// TIMER WAKES ARE DERIVED, NOT SCHEDULED. There is no timer, no sweep entry and
// no wake event: a row is snoozed while `snoozedUntil` is in the future, and
// stops being snoozed when it is not. The sidebar already re-renders on
// `useRelativeNow`'s tick, so the wake costs nothing and — the real prize —
// survives a restart, a window move and a machine asleep past the wake time
// with no recovery path to get wrong.
//
// This module only DECIDES. The sidebar renders the decision; the store writes
// the fields. Same division as `workspaceSettle.ts`, whose shape this mirrors
// on purpose — the two rules are read side by side.

 *    should be able to snooze whatever you want" — and under suspend the
 *    question is not lost, it simply waits in the CLI session and is re-asked
 *    when the person resumes the terminal themselves.
 *  - Turn-ended could no longer fire honestly once snoozing suspended the
 *    terminals: a sleeping chat has no process to finish a turn. What it could
 *    still do was fire by ACCIDENT — snooze a working chat and a Stop hook
 *    landing in the moment before the suspend does would un-snooze the row the
 *    person had just put away.
 *
 * So the rule is the clock and only the clock, which is also the thing a person
