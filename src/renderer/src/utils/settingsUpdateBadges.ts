// The update badges Settings wears (owner ruling 2026-09-25): an agent CLI with
// a newer release, and a newer SprintEngine Studio, each point the person at the
// place that installs it — and they point there from wherever the person is.
//
//   Settings rail glyph   every outstanding update, CLI and app together
//   Settings ▸ General    the app update
//   Settings ▸ Agents     the CLI updates
//   machine switcher      the CLI updates on that machine
//   a CLI's row           that CLI on that machine, beside its Update button
//
// One derivation feeds all five, so the glyph, the nav and the rows can never
// disagree about how many there are. A CLI behind on two machines is two
// updates: each is its own Update button, on its own machine's list. Every one
// is the kit's count badge, named ("2 updates available") so the number is
// never the only thing a screen reader or a person who does not see the accent
// gets.
//
// An update stops being counted when it is installed (the advisory stops saying
// `behind_latest`; the app state stops offering a version) or when the person
// dismisses it — pressing Dismiss or Later on its toast. A dismissal names one
// version (and, for the app, one step), so the next release badges again.
// Dismissing clears the badges and nothing else: the Update button and the
// version line stay, because the update is still there to take.
//
// Pure: the hook that reads the stores is `useSettingsUpdateBadges`.
