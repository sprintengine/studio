// Chats that came to rest through a registry change this window did not

// A Settle is more than its record. A resting chat holds no processes (owner
// ruling 2026-09-07), and the chat you are in hands you on to the next one; the
// sidebar does both for a Settle made in it. One that arrives from elsewhere
// lands in the store as a field patch, which says nothing about either, so the
// store's inbound path notes it here and the sidebar carries out the rest
// (`settledElsewhere` in WorkspaceSidebar). Held until the sidebar takes it,
// so a note made before it mounts is not lost.
