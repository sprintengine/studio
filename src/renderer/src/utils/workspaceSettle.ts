// workspace on disk and in the store, and opening it brings it back — but it
// is no longer free of consequence: a resting chat holds no terminals (owner
// ruling 2026-09-07), so the ptys are killed with the row and the agent
// resumes from its CLI session when the chat is next opened. This module

/**

 *    Settle included: new activity resumes the usual rules, the same way a
 *    keystroke does) and blocks settling an active one.
 *  - `held`: the row wants the person — blocked on a prompt, or wearing the
 *    unseen "finished while you were away" mark. A thing to look at, not
 *    activity: it blocks settling, and it wakes a row the SWEEP settled (a
 *    row that wants the person does not belong in the shelf unless the
 *    person put it there — the sweep can only have settled it on a reading
 *    taken before the sessions were known). It never wakes a hand Settle: a
 *    prompt is a persistent state that was already true when Settle was
 *    chosen, so treating it as a wake would undo every Settle within a tick
 *    until the prompt is answered.
 *  - `active`: the row someone is looking at in some window. Being looked at
 *    is not activity either: selecting a settled row to read it keeps it
 *    settled, and an active row that has gone quiet is simply never settled
 *    out from under the person.
