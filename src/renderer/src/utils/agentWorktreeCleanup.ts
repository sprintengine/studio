/**
 * What the agent worktree cleanup (main's agent-worktree-cleanup.ts) is asked
 * to sweep, and what it must leave alone, read off the app's own records.
 *
 * Protected — never removed, whatever git says about them:
 * - every workspace's folder: a chat opened on a worktree IS its folder, and
 *   the person can come back to it until the chat is deleted;
 * - every path an agent record points at (its worktree entry or its cwd),
 *   because a parked agent can be resumed into it;
 * - every worktree entry still `assigned` to an agent that exists, or
 *   mid-`removing`.
 *
 * Except a SETTLED chat, which counts as deleted (owner ruling 2026-10-08):
 * nothing it records keeps anything. Its folder, every path its agents and
 * worktree entries point at, its agents (so a slot one of them leased for
 * itself goes back) and its branches are all left out, and the sweep's own
 * rules decide. Offered, not given: main still keeps a worktree with changes,
 * or with ignored files that may be work, and removing a worktree never
 * deletes an unmerged branch, so returning to the chat checks it out again
 * when its branch is still there (`chatWorktreeRestore.ts`). A settled chat
 * someone has open in a window (`activeWorkspaceIds`) keeps everything while
 * it is looked at. A project's own checkout is never the sweep's to take,
 * whichever chat sits in it.
 *
 * An entry still marked `assigned` to an agent that no longer exists is an
 * orphan from before agents released their worktrees, and is NOT protected:
 * that is exactly the backlog this sweep exists to clear.
 *
 * Every agent the records hold is named, because a worktree pool slot an agent
 * leased for itself (MCP `worktree.lease`) is in use while that agent exists,
 * wherever its terminal sits. Each is named with its chat as well
 * (`agentKeys`): an agent id is unique only within its chat. Every branch a
 * chat or worktree entry records is named too: main deletes merged `agent/`
 * branches, but never one a chat that is not settled may still be restored
 * from (`chatWorktreeRestore.ts`).
 *
 * Every project root the records mention is swept. Main's own rules decide
 * what in it is an agent worktree at all (`agent/<slug>` in the app's
 * container) and whether it is clean and merged.
