// The data side of a file tree, one per ROOT and shared by every view of that
// root in this window: the directory listings read so far, one watch on the
// root, a debounced re-read when the watch fires, the `git check-ignore`
// answers per folder, and the reveal that lists a file's ancestors.
//
// It used to live in the Files pane's component state, which meant a second
// tree (the editor window's) would have been a second copy of all of it — a
// second watcher on the same root, a second cache, and a second place for
// reveal to read more than it needs. What stays with each VIEW is what is
// genuinely the view's: which folders are open, what is selected, whether a
// rename is in progress. The model never learns any of that, so two views of
// one root can open different folders without either one's choice leaking.
//
// Ref-counted: `acquireFileTreeModel` hands out the model and a release; the
// watch starts with the first holder and stops with the last, and the cache
// goes with it. Views read it through `useSyncExternalStore`, the same way the
// editor buffers are read (utils/editorBuffers.ts).
