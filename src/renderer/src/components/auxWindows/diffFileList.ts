// `changelist` narrows the list to ONE changelist's files (agent changelists):
// the files it owns whole plus the files it owns a piece of, which is exactly
// `pathsOfChangelist` — a partially-owned file is a file you must be able to
// step to, or the hunks the list owns inside it are unreachable from a filtered
// window. Absent, nothing is filtered and this is the function it always was.
//
// Everything downstream stays the same: the order, the two kinds, the exclusion
// of conflicts. A filter that emptied the list is an EMPTY list, not a fallback
// to everything — the viewer says whose list it is and offers the way back
// (DiffViewer's filtered empty state), because silently showing all changes
// under a header that names an agent is the one answer nobody can read.
