/**
 * A WHOLE-FILE move — the toolbar's `‹ 2/27 files ›` stepper and ⌘↑ / ⌘↓
 * (git-commit-window T4), as opposed to the hunk stepping above.
 *
 * Three things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 * - **It does not wrap.** Past the last file is `none`, exactly as the hunk
 *   walk stops at the last hunk of the last file. The stepper's chevrons
 *   disable there rather than looping, so a person paging through 27 files
 *   never lands back on file 1 without asking to.
 * - **It does not skip a file with no hunks.** The move is `{type:'file'}`
 *   like a hunk overflow's, so the caller resolves it through the same
 *   `pendingEdgeRef` / `resolveEdgeHunkIndex` path — and that path clamps an
 *   empty diff to hunk 0 rather than stepping over the file. A binary or
 *   mode-only change IS one of the 27; the counter would lie if it could not
 *   be reached.
 * - **It always lands on `first`.** Stepping to the *file* means the top of it
 *   in both directions; only a hunk walk that fell off the top of a file wants
 *   the previous file's last hunk.
