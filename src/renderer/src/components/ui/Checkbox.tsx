// The kit's checkbox. Five surfaces had each styled the same
// `<input type="checkbox">` independently — 3px and 3.5px boxes, one on the
// browser's `accent-color`, one with a hand-rolled ring whose `ring-offset-color`
// was pinned to `--bg-surface-raised` and therefore wrong on any other surface,
// and one with no focus treatment at all. The most complete of them — the
// styled-peer box in the tracker write-back settings, which is what motivated
// `FOCUS_RING_PEER_CLASS` — is what this promotes. (That surface has since been
// retired with the native tracker layer; the primitive it produced outlived it.)
//
// The native input stays: it carries the semantics, the keyboard path, the
// indeterminate state and form participation. The visible box is decorative and
// hidden from assistive tech, and takes the shared focus treatment through the
// input's `:focus-visible` via `peer`. Nothing here re-implements a checkbox —
// it dresses one.

   * MARKER MODE — the box is a rendered FACT, not a control: a GFM task-list
   * marker inside rendered markdown, where the checked state comes from the
   * document and toggling it here would change nothing.
   *
   * Three things follow, and each is why this could not be `disabled`:
   *
   * - **No `<label>` wrapper.** The marker sits inside an `<li>` whose text is
   *   already the item; wrapping that text in a label would make the whole
   *   paragraph a click target for a control that does not accept clicks, and
   *   would nest a label inside prose the markdown renderer owns.
   * - **No `onChange`.** React needs `readOnly` on a controlled input with no
   *   handler; without it every rendered task list logs a warning per box.
   * - **Not `disabled`.** A disabled input is skipped by some assistive tech
   *   and reads as "unavailable"; this box is neither. `aria-readonly` says the
   *   true thing: the state is real, and it is not yours to change here.
   *
   * The drawn box is the kit's, unchanged — a task list that invented its own
   * tick is how five surfaces came to draw five checkboxes.

 * for existing at all: five surfaces once drew five checkboxes. There is one
 * drawing, and both callers render it.
 *
 * Always `aria-hidden`. Whatever announces the state — this component's own
 * `<input>`, or the row's `aria-checked` — the box is the picture of it and
