/**
 * The setting row and the card it lives in — the shipped counterpart of
 * `design-system/components/setting-row`.
 *
 * The card ships with the row rather than being left to the caller for the
 * same reason `DescribedCheckRowList` does: the divider's inset and the row's
 * padding are one decision, and a host drawing its own `divide-y` puts the
 * rule at its own inset. Thirteen hand-rolled wrappers is exactly how the
 * settings tabs ended up with three different insets and two different divider
 * colours.
 *
 * Card, not bare rows, by ruling 2026-09-14 (`foundations/principles.md`,
 * *Hairlines carry the structure*): a settings page is a long scroll of rows
 * with nothing in common, and past eight rows the gap between two groups reads
 * the same as the gap between two rows.
 */

/**
 * The card a run of setting rows sits in: `border.subtle`, `radius.shell`,
 * `bg.surface-raised`, hairlines between rows and never around them.
 *
 * A plain `<div>` with no role by default: a card of unrelated settings is not
 * a list and must not claim to be one. Pass `as="ul"` when the rows genuinely
 * *are* a list of like things (paired devices, tailnet machines, recent
 * messages) — then the rows are `<li>`s and `ariaLabel` names the list.
 *
 * That list form is the **list card** (ruled 2026-09-15): the one surface every
 * list of things in Settings and in the Extensions door sits in — agent CLIs,
 * version-control providers, knowledge projects, modules, plugins, skills. The
 * Remote tab's machines list drew it first; the rest of the product conforms
 * to it rather than each list deciding its own edge.
