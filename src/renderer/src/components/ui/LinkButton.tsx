// The TEXT LINK that is a button — an action set inside a sentence
// (design-system/components/link-button).
//
// "Reconnect" at the end of a ` · `-separated state line. "More" under a clamped
// description. "Search GitHub" beside a field. A repo path inside rendered
// markdown that opens a file rather than a URL. None of these navigates, so none
// of them is an `<a href>`; all of them read as prose, so none of them is a
// button with a box.
//
// The kit had no answer. `GhostButton` is the quietest member and still brings a
// 26px control height, an 8px inset, `font-medium` and a hover fill — put that
// inside a 20px metadata line and the line grows, the words either side stop
// being level with it, and the "link" reads as a control someone forgot to
// finish. So every one of these stayed a raw `<button>` with `border-0
// bg-transparent p-0` written out by hand, which is four utilities cancelling
// the browser rather than a shape the system named.
//
// What it is: baseline flow, the caller's own type unless it asks otherwise, an
// ink pair, an optional underline, and the product's one focus ring. Nothing
// else. It is the smallest member of the button family and the only one with no
// box at all.

/**
 * - `accent` (default) — accent ink, deepening to `accent.hover`, underlined on
 *   hover. Accent as INK is inside the budget (`principles.md` → The accent
 *   budget); what the budget forbids is the accent as a fill, which this never
 *   takes.
 * - `quiet` — `text.muted` lifting to `text.primary`, with a PERSISTENT
 *   underline in `border.strong`. The disclosure case: "More", "Show details".
 *   The underline is standing rather than on hover because a quiet link with no
 *   underline and no box is indistinguishable from the sentence around it.
