   * caller spelling the pressed fill in `className` writes a plain `bg-…` and a
   * `text-…` that meet `GHOST_TONE`'s own utilities at equal specificity, so
   * which of them paints is stylesheet order rather than what the caller wrote
   * — and the tone's `hover:bg-…` outranks a plain `bg-…` outright, so the
   * pressed fill vanished the moment a pointer touched it. Also supplies
   * `aria-pressed` when the caller has not, since a pressed control that does
   * not say so is only pressed for people who can see it.
   *
   * Tri-state ON PURPOSE, so leave it undefined on a button that is not a
   * toggle. `undefined` emits no attribute (a Close or Delete glyph is an
   * action, and announcing it as an unpressed toggle is a lie); `false` emits
   * `aria-pressed="false"`, which is what a toggle that is currently OFF owes
   * a screen reader. A `= false` default collapsed those two cases and made
   * every toggle in the app announce as a plain button while off — the footer
   * modal triggers regressed exactly that way on 2026-09-02. It matches the
   * house idiom already used by TaskCard (`onSelect ? selected : undefined`)
   * and SpawnDebugToggle.

/**
 * The window's own caption buttons — minimise, maximise/restore, close — on
 * Windows and Linux, where the frame is ours to draw.
 *
 * It is a species rather than an `IconButton` size because every one of its
 * departures is the operating system's rather than the system's, and each would
 * be a defect anywhere else in the product:
 *
 * - **No height and no radius.** The control stretches to the title strip
 *   (`self-stretch`) and fills its corner square. A rounded caption button
 *   floating inside the strip is not what any desktop draws.
 * - **`w-control-lg` (40px) and no more.** The caption cluster's width is the
 *   platform's; it is the one place a control's width is not a content measure.
 * - **A `focus:` fill, not `focus-visible:`.** The OS-standard keyboard
 *   highlight on a caption button shows on plain focus. The RING is still the
 *   product's one focus indicator and is still `focus-visible`; this is a
 *   second, weaker ground underneath it, not a replacement.
 * - **The ring is INSET.** An outset ring at the window's top-right corner is
 *   clipped by the frame.
 *
 * `close` additionally paints the Windows-native hover red, which is a brand
 * colour of the platform's in exactly the sense a vendor mark is
 * (`principles.md` → Identity colour): tokenising it would replace a colour
 * every other window on the machine agrees on with one of ours.
