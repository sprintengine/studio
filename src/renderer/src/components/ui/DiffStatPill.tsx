// added half in the diff green on its wash, the removed half in the diff red on
// its wash, touching, under one pill corner (design-system/components/diff-stat-pill).
//
// The inks and washes are the diff channel's own (`--diff-added` /
// `--diff-removed` over `--tone-good-soft` / `--tone-error-soft`), the pair the
// diff viewer already draws its lines in, so a theme that tunes its diff
// colours moves this pill with its diffs rather than with its status tones.
//
// A half with nothing to say is not drawn: no "+0", no "−0". Nothing to say at
// all draws nothing — a clean checkout is not a zero worth a pill.
