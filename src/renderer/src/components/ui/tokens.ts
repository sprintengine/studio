// The product's one focus indicator: a 2px --border-focus outline at a 2px
// offset, declared once as the `focus-ring` utility in assets/index.css.
//
// The utility name is the single source, not these constants: markup that
// writes `focus-visible:focus-ring` into a className string lands on the same
// rule, and moving the treatment means editing the utility, never a consumer.
// What no component may do is declare a treatment of its own — a
// `focus-visible:ring-*` or `focus-visible:outline-*` carrying its own width or
// colour, which is how the accent collision below survived nineteen themes.
// That is enforced in ui/accessibility-contracts.test.ts. Prefer these four
// constants in new code: they carry the trigger's rationale, and the
// non-obvious ones (peer, wrapper) are easy to get wrong from memory.
//
// The offset is load-bearing, not decoration: --border-focus and
// --accent-primary are the same value in 18 of the 19 themes, so a zero-offset
// ring on an accent-filled control (PrimaryButton, a checked Switch) had nothing
// to contrast with and focused rendered identically to unfocused. The
// transparent gap is what separates them, and unlike `ring-offset-color` it
// assumes nothing about the fill behind the control.
//
// No `outline-none` companion: the outline replaces the UA one, and pairing it
// with an equal-specificity `focus:outline-none` would make which wins a matter
// of stylesheet order.
// WRITTEN OUT IN FULL, NEVER ASSEMBLED FROM `'focus-ring'` + a variant prefix.
// Tailwind v4 generates a rule only for a class candidate it can SEE as literal
// text while scanning source, and it does not evaluate template literals: a
// constant built as `` `peer-focus-visible:${FOCUS_RING_UTILITY}` `` produces no
// CSS at all, so every consumer of it silently renders with no focus indicator.
// That is not hypothetical — it is how two of the four below shipped inert
// (T13 review, 2026-07-30). `focus-visible:focus-ring` and its `-inset` form
// survived only by accident: dozens of components also write them literally in
// their own className strings, which is what put them in the stylesheet. The
// two rarer variants — `peer-focus-visible:` and `has-[input:focus]:` — had no
// such literal anywhere, so they were absent from the built CSS entirely and
// their only consumers (TrackerWriteBackSettings' checkbox, InboxSearchInput's
// wrapper) rendered with no focus indicator at all.
//
// So: one literal per constant, and grep for the literal — not for the constant
// name — when checking whether a variant reaches the CSS.

 * is how a second idiom starts.
 *
 * Two things about a terminal put it outside the four:
 *   - The tab stop is not the element that should light up. xterm owns a hidden
 *     `<textarea>` inside the canvas, so focus lands on a descendant and
 *     `:focus-visible` on the container never matches. The rule keys off
 *     `:focus-within`, which covers both that textarea and the container's own
 *     `tabIndex={0}`. `has-[input:focus]` cannot stand in: it is a textarea.
 *   - An outline at the panel edge is clipped. The canvas fills a FlexLayout tab
 *     whose rounded corners and top border cut it off, so the indicator is drawn
 *     as an inset `::after` overlay sitting inside the panel padding, clear of
 *     the terminal's first row.
 *
 * What it is NOT is a second treatment: the rule takes its border from
 * `var(--focus-ring)`, the same 2px in the theme's own `--border-focus` that the
 * utility applies, so moving the indicator still means editing one value.
