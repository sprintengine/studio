// all draw this ring for this fact, so it arrives already legible. Which is
// also why it is a ring and not a bar or a number — a number has to be read,
// and this sits beside a title at 14px with no room to read one. The number is
// still there, in the tooltip and in the accessible name, for anyone who wants
// it.

// nothing is loading, and the value falls as well as rises (a compaction gives
// context back).
