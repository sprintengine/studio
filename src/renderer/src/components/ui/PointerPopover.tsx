// Pointer-positioned popover for RICH content — the coordinate-anchored analog of

// to `ContextMenu` (which is for roving menu-item lists only). Opens at a viewport
// point, clamps inside the viewport, and dismisses on outside pointerdown or
// Escape. Children own their own internal roles; the surface carries the popup
// role so a portaled rich body (search field, listboxes, nested flyouts that
// position themselves `fixed`) reads as one menu/dialog.
//
// Nested `fixed` flyouts rendered by the children stay DOM descendants of this
// surface, so the contains() check keeps them from dismissing their own parent.
