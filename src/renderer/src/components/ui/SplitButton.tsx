// Split button — one bordered group carrying a default action and a menu of
// alternatives (design-system/components/split-button). The primary half runs
// the last-used target; the chevron half lists every target and re-points the
// primary.
//
// Handed FEWER THAN TWO targets it draws the primary half alone, with the
// group's own chrome and no chevron. That is the spec's rule ("keep the menu at
// two or more rows; one alternative is a plain button") made true by the
// component instead of asked of every caller — a chevron whose menu holds one
// row is a control that opens to say nothing. It matters that this is the same
// code rather than a lookalike: the peek's pull request mark is one or several
// depending on what the conversation did, and when its solo arm was a text link
// of its own it lost the 24px hit floor and the hover fill the group gives its
// half, so the SAME mark was a 15px target with one pull request and a 24px one
// with two.
//
// The group owns the border, the radius, and the height; the halves are
// borderless and separated by one internal hairline. That is what keeps it a
// single object rather than two buttons that happen to touch. Because the group
// clips its overflow (so each half's hover fill follows the rounded corners),
// the focus ring is drawn INSET — an outer ring would be cut off.
//
// The menu is the shared `Popover` on `role="menu"`, with `MenuItem` rows and
// `roveMenuFocus` for arrow-key nav, so this adds no menu idiom of its own.
