// MC-2119 — the ratchet.
//
// Color hygiene in this renderer is near-perfect (a handful of non-test hex
// literals, most of them theme-blind canvases and brand marks) and px font
// sizes are effectively gone. Not because anyone is more careful about color:
// because `designSystemConformance.test.tsx` and the token lint POLICE color,
// and nothing polices the rest. The unpoliced axes are exactly where the
// off-ramps live, and nothing stopped the count growing.
//
// So this file is deliberately not a "fix everything" gate. It is two kinds of
// assertion, per the shape MC-2119 asks for:
//
//   HARD RULES — the kit (`components/ui/`) consumes the token, full stop.
//     A primitive that spells a shadow, a stacking tier or a type step by hand
//     is not a primitive; every host that copies it inherits the off-ramp.
//     These are at zero and must stay there.
//
//   RATCHETS — the app tree carries a checked-in per-directory count.
//     Going DOWN is a one-line edit to the baseline below. Going UP fails, and
//     names the directory. This is how ~476 radius off-ramps drain without a
//     big-bang sweep that would touch every file in the renderer at once.
//
// The counts are read from source text rather than from a rendered tree on
// purpose: these are repo-wide questions ("how many places spell a radius by
// hand"), and mounting every component to ask them is neither possible nor
// useful. The rendered-class contracts stay in `designSystemConformance.test.tsx`.
//
// The epic's exit condition is every baseline at zero.

  // that spells neither. `ModalButton` accounts for the kit's one: it is a name
  // for the footer's three roles now, not a fourth button with a radius.
  // The 2026-08-05 field drop — settings 36 → 30, workspace 186 → 184, panels
  // 150 → 148, learn 2 → 1, modules 2 → 1 — is the input consolidation
  // (MC-2114). Every hand-rolled field in the settings tabs, the connectors
  // form, the creation wizard's knowledge step, the Learn centre's search and
  // the voice-dictation section gave up its own `rounded-md` for `ui/Input`,
  // which spells the control radius once; the New sprint dialog's run-name
  // field gave up a bare `rounded` (Tailwind's 4px default, off the ramp
  // entirely) for the kit's in-place title edit.
  // The 2026-08-05 menu/header drop — radius workspace 183 → 174, panels
  // 146 → 145, backlog 20 → 19, ui 12 → 9; type panels 18 → 17; icon ui
  // 22 → 21 — is the long tail outside the guards' directory scope (MC-2138).
  // Every menu row that had hand-rolled its own `rounded` fill (the roster
  // popover, both menubar fallbacks, the account menu, the reasoning selector,
  // the skills and connector pickers) takes `MENU_ITEM_CLASS`, which spells no

  // height — the kit's `WorkspacePanel` and `FilePreviewPane`, the
  // knowledge-graph drawer, both HTML-artifact bands — gave up their local
  // buttons for `ui/PanelHeader` and the kit primitives inside it.
  // The 2026-08-06 radius drop — workspace 174 → 169 — was MC-2122's spawn
  // consolidation: `AgentComposerPopover` was deleted outright and its
  // replacement hung off the model picker's own popover surface instead of
  // hand-rolling a second one, so five `rounded-*` spellings left the tree with
  // it. (That replacement, `agentComposer/SpawnPicker.tsx`, was itself deleted

  // left as headroom, which is what lets the next regression show up as one.

// agreement structural: the values live in `menuClasses.ts`, every host
// consumes them, and none of them can restate one. So these assertions moved
