// Z-index ladder for the renderer. ONE ladder of record, and it is the design
// system's — `--sem-z-*`, aliased into the app as `--z-*` in assets/index.css
// (MC-2119). This comment used to declare a second one, and the two disagreed
// about the top of the stack:
//
//   in-flow depth       --z-sticky 10 (sticky headers, in-card raise),
//                       --z-pane 20 (docked panes, in-canvas floating chrome),
//                       --z-float 30 (panel-internal popovers and HUDs) —
//                       `sem.z.sticky` / `sem.z.pane` / `sem.z.float` in
//                       design-system/foundations/tokens.tokens.json. These
//                       describe depth within a pane, not overlay layers; they
//                       used to exist only in this comment, as Tailwind's
//                       `z-20` / `z-30`, until 2026-09-02 put them in the source.
//   overlay layers      --z-drawer 40, --z-modal 70, --z-popover 80,
//                       --z-menu 90, --z-toast 100.
//
// The ordering is deliberate (interaction-canon merge review, 2026-08-05):
// TRANSIENT surfaces sit ABOVE modal. A popover, menu, or tooltip opened from
// inside a dialog is always the topmost, self-dismissing thing on screen — at
// the old popover 50 / menu 60 / modal 70 ladder, every picker a dialog hosted
// painted UNDER its own scrim. Modal beats the page and the drawer; the
// transient family beats modal; toast beats everything. Consuming the token
// removes the second ladder this file used to carry.
