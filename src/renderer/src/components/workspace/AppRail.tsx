// The app rail (app shell, 2026-09-05): the narrow column of glyphs at
// the window's far left that decides what the sidebar column beside it shows,
// and holds the product's standing tools. The rail sits outside the sidebar — the rail names AREAS of the
// product, the sidebar lists the THINGS inside the chosen area, and the two
// never share a column.
//
// Glyphs only (owner ruling, 2026-09-05, revising the captioned first cut): a
// house and a tile grid do not need the words "Home" and "Extensions" under
// them, and the caption was what made the rail 76px wide. One glyph column
// keeps the name on hover and in the accessible name — the same idiom the
// sidebar's collapsed rows already use.
//
// THREE glyphs, top to bottom (Extensions drawer ruling, 2026-09-05, revising
// the four-glyph cut of the same day):
//   Home        — the sidebar shows New chat and the workspaces tree.
//   Automations — the Automations surface takes the card region, with its own
//                 list of automations in the sidebar column beside it.
//   Extensions  — the sidebar becomes the Extensions drawer (Design, Plugins,
//                 Skills, Agent CLIs) and the Extensions home takes the card
//                 region.
// Plugins left the rail: it is one of the things UNDER Extensions, and a
// glyph of its own said it stood beside them. Automations stays because it is
// what the product does rather than something added to it — and it is still
// the automations module's own registered surface, glyph and label taken from
// the registry and gated on the module's enablement, so a disabled module's
// glyph is simply not there.
//
// This is window chrome, not a rail in the context-rail sense
// (`design-system/patterns/context-rail.html`, "one rail, ever"). That ruling is
// about NAVIGATION columns — a list a person walks — and it still holds for the
// sidebar column: a door's rail replaces the sidebar's content, never sits
// beside it. The app rail holds no list. It is a fixed set of glyphs, the way
// the title strip is a fixed set of window controls, and it stays put while
// everything to its right swaps.
//
// Geometry. The rail is a layout measure like SIDEBAR_DEFAULT_WIDTH, not a
// token: a `size.control.lg` square plus a `space.sm` gutter each side, which
// is also the width the account cluster at its foot sits in. The rail's
// squares are a step above the product's largest in-panel control (owner ruling
// 2026-09-07, revising the 46px control-md cut): the point of the column is to
// be found from across the window, and 34px squares carrying 18px glyphs were
// read rather than seen. Its top reserves the title strip's height on every
// platform so the first glyph sits below the chrome row beside it. On macOS the
// native traffic lights, which the hiddenInset frame pins at x:12
// (window-factory.ts), start in that reserve and run past the rail's edge — the
// sidebar's chrome row insets for the remainder (SidebarChrome,
// TRAFFIC_LIGHT_RESERVE − APP_RAIL_WIDTH).

// The registered surfaces that stand on the rail, in rail order. Ids, not
// modules. One of them today: the ruling promotes only Automations. The
// mechanism stays a LIST because what the rail holds is a ruling rather than a
// constant of the code — a second standing tool would join it here rather than
// be hand-placed in the JSX.
