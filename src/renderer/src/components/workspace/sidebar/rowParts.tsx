// A shelf's fold row (settled-chats, 2026-09-07): the one line a folder shows
// for a group of parked chats — its name, and how many — collapsed by default,
// in the fold-row idiom the older-rows disclosure used to carry. The section
// rule applies (design-system/components/section): a heading earns its place by
// separating one group from another, so the row renders only when the folder
// has rows to separate from its active ones.
//
// Snoozed (sleep, 2026-09-10) is the shelf that uses it; Settled had one too
// until settled chats moved to Settings ▸ Settled chats (owner, 2026-09-28).
//
// It sits in the background (owner, 2026-09-28): the rows it folds away are
// ones the person has said "not now" about, so the line counting them is never
// the kit row's `text.default`. The label rests at `text.subtle` — the quiet
// row's title tier — at the smaller `text-meta` step, and the count and the
// chevron go one step further down to `text.disabled`. Under the pointer or
// keyboard focus the label lifts to `text.default`, the same lift a quiet row's
// title takes, so reaching for it is never reading dim text.
//
// The ink is on the spans, not the button: RowButton's resting `text.default`
// and a caller's `text-*` on one element are resolved by stylesheet order, not
// class order. The group is named (`group/shelf`) so hovering the folder
// section around it, which is a `group` of its own, does not lift it.
