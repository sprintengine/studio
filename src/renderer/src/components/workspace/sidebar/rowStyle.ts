// The complaint it answers, verbatim: "I'm finding it a little bit difficult to
// really see which terminal I'm in control of." The selected row was a neutral
// fill and an ink lift, which is one step of grey; the rows around it wearing
// `needs-input` gold or `unseen-done` green were a hue, a whole-row wash AND a
// ring. The loudest row on the rail was reliably not the one the person was in,
// and the green ring in particular read as "you are here" because it is the
// same mark the FOCUSED TERMINAL wears (`terminal-focus-ring`, a 2px
// --border-focus border). So the two vocabularies are now split down the
// middle: a tint says what happened on a row, an edge says which row you are
// in, and the rail and the terminal it drives wear that edge together.
//
// `--selection-edge` rather than `--accent-primary` directly: the resting-tier
// rules in assets/index.css rebind it to `transparent` on a pane that is not
// holding focus, the same way they rebind the fill and the ink lift. Naming the
// accent here would opt the sidebar out of tiering.

// type glyph went), and the glyph ink was the ONLY thing the mode accents ever
// differed by — every mode's fill and ink were already identical. So one
// accent stands for every mode.
//
// The active row body sits on the brighter `--bg-selected` surface — the same
// canonical selection fill used elsewhere (notifications, file/artifact
// selection) — so the selected row clears the hover `--bg-surface-raised` fill
// by a full step.
//
// The colored 4px left rail is gone: selection is a neutral fill and carries no
// left bar (`design-system/patterns/selection.html`). A collapsed icon rail is
// the one place the design system still permits a stripe — rows there are too
// narrow for a fill to read — but this sidebar has no such rail to except:
// collapsing hides the whole aside rather than narrowing it to icons (the
