/**
 * One terminal's line under a row's title (sidebar-lists-every-terminal):
 * mark · branch · ±lines · seat. The row shows one per live terminal in
 * place of the head pile and the single row-level branch it used to carry:
 * the lines are the count, and each says where IT is — an agent in a
 * worktree of its own reads at full strength, with the path on hover.
 *
 * The terminal's NAME is not row text: it is the mark's tooltip and
 * accessible name, so the line spends its width on where the terminal is and
 * what it changed rather than on a name the row's title already implies.
 *
 * Truncation is an ordered give-way, not a fixed cap: the branch yields
 * (weight 3) down to its floor; the mark, the diff and the seat never
 * shrink. The line clips at the row's gutter rather than spilling past it.
 *
 * `seatOverlay` is the row's hover-revealed actions, handed to the first
 * line only; the seat's own content steps aside for it on hover, as the
 * row-level seat always did.
