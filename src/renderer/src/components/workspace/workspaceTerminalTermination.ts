 * agent process running, the row just there. Snooze first shipped as
 * visibility-only — the row left the list and every pty stayed up — which made
 * a chat you had told to go away the most expensive kind of row in the tree,
 * holding a CLI process for the whole snooze. Visibility-only is the right rule
 * for a snooze whose session lives on a SERVER, where hiding costs nothing;
 * ours holds a live local process, so hiding the row is not putting it away.
 *
 * Suspend rather than kill because a snoozed chat is coming back on a clock.
 * `terminalSuspend` ends the agent PROCESS but keeps the painted, resumable
 * session, and the first keystroke relaunches it under the same session id with
 * `--resume` (TerminalView's `resumeFromSuspend`). Nothing here and nothing on
 * the wake path resumes anything: waking returns the row to the sidebar with
 * its terminals still paused, and the person's own keystroke is what starts an
 * agent again.
 *
 * Failures are absorbed for the reason the kill path absorbs them: a session
 * that is already gone must not hold up a gesture whose whole job is to get a
 * row out of the way.
