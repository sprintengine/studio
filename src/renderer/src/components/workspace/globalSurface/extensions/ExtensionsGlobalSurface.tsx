// The Extensions door: three catalogues behind one surface id.
//
// Source-tabs ruling (2026-09-05). The door used to be a rail of seven rows —
// Featured, Plugins, MCP servers, Skills, Automations, Modules, Agent CLIs —
// over a canvas per row. It is three views now, each the same page:
//
//   Plugins · Skills · Agent CLIs
//
// and the things that left are each somewhere better: the Automations shelf's
// five built-ins are the Automations surface's "Built in" list, Modules are
// switches in Settings → Modules (they were offered in two shapes on two
// surfaces), the automation server is a Settings concern rather than a
// catalogue row, and Featured ranked the catalogue by a fact about the machine.
//
// What this file owns is what the three views SHARE and nothing else: the
// reads (the MCP catalogue, the marketplace registry, the sources and their
// scans), the two ways a source is added, which view the drawer is standing on,
// and the tab that view is on — because the ruling says the chosen source
// survives a switch between Plugins and Skills.
