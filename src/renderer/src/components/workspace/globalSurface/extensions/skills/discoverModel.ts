// Discover's own model: the input discipline the search budget forces, and the
// small facts a result row is allowed to state.
//
// GitHub's code search allows ten requests a minute, so a keystroke cannot be a
// request. `createSkillSearchScheduler` is that rule as one testable object:
// nothing is sent below the minimum length, and a burst of keystrokes collapses
// into one request after the quiet window. Its timers are injected, so the
// coalescing is proven against a fake clock rather than a sleeping test.
//
// Nothing here derives a skill count, a ranking, or a dedupe. Those are the
// scan's to answer, and Discover's whole rule is that a hit is a candidate.
