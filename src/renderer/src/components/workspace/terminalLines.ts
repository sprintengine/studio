 * - `worktree` / `branch` / `folder` — the checkout's git reading, exactly as
 *   main's workspace-change-summary defines them: merge-base(branch, trunk) to
 *   the working tree, uncommitted included, or the folder's uncommitted changes
 *   where there is no branch to measure against.
 * - `landed` — the same checkout's UNCOMMITTED changes alone, shown once the
 *   conversation's primary pull request is merged (owner decision 2026-09-09,
 *   decision 2 of the sidebar-branch-diff ruling). A merge commit or a
 *   fast-forward moves the merge base and the span empties by itself; a SQUASH
 *   merge does not, and a branch whose work has landed must not keep reading
 *   +2000. Merged is only ever GitHub's word through the pull request record
 *   (epic `pull-request-marks`, decision 8c) — never inferred from ancestry.
 *
 * There is deliberately no per-agent scope here any more. The 2026-09-09
 * ruling "no git for a session that has a ledger" is REVERSED: the hook
 * ledger's cumulative tally counts work DONE (a line edited twice counts
 * twice, and work since undone is still in it), which is not what an
 * outstanding diff is. The ledger keeps its two homes — the conversation
 * peek's changed-files list and the agent's changelist — and the sidebar
 * number is what the branch still carries. Two agents on one branch showing
 * the same number is now the correct answer, not the bug it was read as.

 * The numbers a line shows and what they are allowed to claim, from the two

 * state main resolved for the conversation. Pure and exported so the rule can
 * be stated in a test in three lines.
 *
 * - No summary at all (an unresolved checkout, a path git could not be asked
 *   about) → zeros, `folder` scope, and NO file counts: exactly what the line
 *   drew before, and the row draws no chip for zeros anyway.
 * - The primary pull request (`primaryPullRequest`, decision 5 — the most
 *   recent one still OPEN, else the newest of all) is `merged` AND the summary
 *   carries `uncommitted` → the uncommitted numbers, `landed` scope.
 * - Anything else — an open or closed primary, no pull request at all, or a
 *   merged one whose `uncommitted` reading could not be taken → the span, at
 *   the scope git gave it. Never a confident zero: an unreadable reading
 *   degrades to the previous scope, not to 0.
 *
 * The primary rule is what makes a merged pull request followed by a NEW open
 * one go back to the span on its own: the open one becomes the primary.
 *
 * `files` rides beside the line counts and is what the line actually DRAWS
 * (owner decision 2026-09-09, decision 1): the summary numbers are files, and
 * lines survive only where a single file is in view — the hover card's per-file
 * rows and the diff viewer. It is null whenever the reading it belongs to
 * carries no breakdown: a summary from an older main, a span git could not be
 * read for, or the uncommitted reading a `landed` line switched to. Null draws
 * NOTHING; it never falls back to the line counts, because "+202" in a place
 * that means files would be a lie rather than a stale number.
