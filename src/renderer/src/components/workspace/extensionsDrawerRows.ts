// The drawer's six fixed rows plus installed door contributions, RESOLVED
// (Extensions drawer ruling, 2026-09-05, Stage 3; module-door completion,
// 2026-09-13). `extensionsDrawer.ts` says which product rows exist and in what
// order; installed surfaces follow them. This says what every row currently IS
// against the live registry — its name, glyph, selection, and open behaviour.
//
// It exists because the rows are now offered in two places. The drawer column
// lists them, and the Extensions home lists the same set as tiles, and the
// ruling is explicit that a tile "opens the same surface the drawer row does".
// Two resolvers would be two routings: the day a view row's deep-link latch
// changed, the tile would keep opening the old way and only one of the two
// would be found in testing. So the routing is written once, here, and both
// surfaces render what it returns.
//
// Not in `extensionsDrawer.ts` on purpose: that file is a leaf the store reads
// (settingsSlice), and this one reaches React and the workspace store.
