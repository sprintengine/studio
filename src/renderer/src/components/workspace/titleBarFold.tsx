// How much of the title strip's workspace identity survives at the current
// window width — and where the rest of it goes.
//
// The strip used to answer "too narrow" by DELETING segments: the project chip
// vanished below 768px and the branch chip below 640px, both with a bare
// `hidden … md:flex`. A control that disappears is not a responsive control, it
// is a missing feature at that size — the operator's answer to "which branch is
// this workspace on?" was "make the window bigger". Every segment this ladder
// drops now reappears in the identity cluster's overflow menu, so nothing is
// ever unreachable; only its rendering changes.
//
// The ladder is the owner's order (2026-09-04), cheapest loss first:
//
//   0  everything inline
//   1  project + branch keep their glyph and their ±lines, lose their WORDS
//   2  "Open" folds into the overflow menu
//   3  project + branch fold into the overflow menu entirely
//
// The right-hand glyph cluster (Sessions, Remote, Notifications, search) never
// folds. It is app-level chrome that is the same at every width, and it is what
// the operator reaches for while the window is small.

// cluster and the identity cluster once the right-hand glyphs have taken theirs.
// A window-width media query would fold on a 1200px window with the sidebar
// expanded and not fold on a 900px one with it collapsed — the same available
// space, two different answers.
//
// The steps are the cluster's own content budget: ~110px of window nav (plus
// 78px of traffic-light gutter on macOS), then star + name + project + branch +
// Open. Each threshold is the width below which the NEXT segment down the
// ladder no longer fits beside a legible workspace name.
