// What a window does with a `sprintengine://chat/…` link main handed it
// (main/chat-link-router.ts picked the window): select the chat, and bring the
// named agent's tab forward when the chat has that agent. Nothing else — no
// agent starts, nothing is typed or sent.
//
// A chat this window's store does not have was closed, or lives on another
// machine, and the person is told so rather than left wondering whether the
// click reached the app. A workspace the rail hides (a module's background
// host) is not a chat anyone links to, and is answered the same way: opening
// one would leave the person somewhere the rail cannot take them back from.
//
// Main sends the link to the window that holds the chat. One filed under a
// window that is not open is moved here, as "Move to Main Window" would.
//
// Store-free, so every path is tested without a window: WorkspaceManager hands
// in the reads and writes.
