// The live editor, and the ONE file in the tree that imports
// `@excalidraw/excalidraw`. It is reached only through the `React.lazy` in
// `CanvasTab.tsx`, which is what keeps the heaviest dependency in the tree — and
// its stylesheet — out of the boot chunk; `scripts/check-bundle-budget.mjs`
// fails the build if it ever arrives there.
//
// Everything about talking to main lives here too, because the parts that do it
// need values from the library (`reconcileElements`, `CaptureUpdateAction`) and
// importing those anywhere else would defeat the boundary. The tab above owns
// the board's lifecycle; this owns the scene.
//
// The two directions, and why each is shaped the way it is:
//
//   person → main  `onChange` fires on every pointer move, so it is debounced,
//                  and a scene whose version hash has not moved since the last
//                  one sent OR received is not sent at all. Without that second
//                  half, every scene main pushed us would bounce straight back.
//
//   main → editor  A push is a whole scene at a revision, and it is RECONCILED
//                  against what is on screen — which is what keeps the person's
//                  in-flight local edits. `captureUpdate: NEVER` keeps it off
//                  the undo stack: the person's ⌘Z must never undo an agent's
//                  work, and must never re-do it away either.
//
//                  NOT restored first, which is worth saying out loud because
//                  the obvious reading of the library's collaboration example
//                  says to. `restoreElements(remote, local)` in 0.18.1 does
//                  three things to a push that this sync cannot afford:
//                    * it `bumpVersion`s any remote element the LOCAL copy is
//                      ahead of, to `local.version + 1` — which then wins
//                      `reconcileElements`. A stale scene would overwrite the
//                      shape under the person's hand, the exact inversion of
//                      "the person always wins".
//                    * it runs `syncInvalidIndices` over the remote array
//                      ALONE, assigning fractional indices against a list that
//                      is not the merged one and bumping each version it
//                      touches, so the tab would owe main a write for every
//                      push it received.
//                    * it DROPS invisibly small elements (zero width and
//                      height, a linear element with one point) — including a
//                      tombstone for one, so a deletion of a just-created
//                      shape would never reach the tab and the element would
//                      come back from the local side of the reconcile.
//                  Nothing in a push needs repairing: every element main holds
//                  came from the library, either through the worker or through
//                  this tab's own commits, and the cold path — a board read off
//                  disk at mount — goes through `initialData`, which the editor
//                  restores itself. `reconcileElements` ends in the
//                  `syncInvalidIndices` that matters, over the MERGED array.
//
// The gesture rule is the reason the buffer exists: applying a scene while the
// person is dragging replaces the element under their pointer, so a push that
// lands mid-gesture waits for the pointer to come up. Only the newest is kept,
// because each one is the whole board.
//
// KEYBOARD AND CLIPBOARD, since a retained tab stays mounted behind whatever
// the person is actually typing into. The editor puts `copy`, `cut` and
// `paste` listeners on `document` whatever `handleKeyboardGlobally` says, and
// all three begin by asking whether `document.activeElement` is inside their
// own container — `paste` additionally requires the element under the last
// pointer position to be the drawing canvas. Focus in a terminal, the
// composer or another pane therefore falls through every one of them, so a
// mounted-but-hidden board cannot swallow a paste and no guard of ours is
// needed. (Verified against the shipped source, not the docs.) `keyup` is the
// one document listener with no such test, but it only ever sets editor state
// and never calls `preventDefault` or `stopPropagation`, so nothing can be
// taken from the surface that has focus.
//
// App chords keep working with a board focused because the shell resolves them
// on `window` in the CAPTURE phase, which runs before anything the editor
// binds; the only keys the editor stops are unmodified single letters (its
// tool shortcuts), and those are not app chords. Focus inside its text editing
// is a `<textarea>`, which the shell's own suppression rule already treats as
// "the person is typing" — the same answer Monaco and the terminal get.
