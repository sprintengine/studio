// The context strip tucked under the composer box and one piece with it:
// rounded at the bottom only, inset from the box's sides, its top hidden under
// the box's lower edge (owner ruling 2026-10-04). ONE container, because the
// New chat composer and an open conversation's composer wear the same strip —
// what it holds differs (a launch's choices; a running chat's facts), the
// object does not.
//
// Always exactly one line (owner ruling 2026-10-04): it never wraps. Its items
// sit apart by spacing alone — no divider — and each is `whitespace-nowrap`
// and keeps its width, except a branch name and a project's name, the items
// allowed to shrink (the branch first, from its front; the project truncating
// at its end), so the controls beside them stay in reach. What does not fit is the host's to move elsewhere (the conversation
// strip folds items into a "⋮" menu); clipping along the line is only the
// last guard against a host that has not, and it clips sideways alone so a
// focus ring above or below an item is never cut.
