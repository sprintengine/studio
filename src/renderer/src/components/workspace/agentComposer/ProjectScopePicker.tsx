// "Which project is this about?", as one chip.
//
// It was a local function inside `NewAgentPanel` until the Design door needed
// the same control: that door opens from the Extensions drawer and silently
// bound to whichever workspace happened to be focused last, so pointing the app
// at a different folder made it claim knowledge of a project the user never
// chose (owner, 2026-09-07). Two surfaces asking the same question have to ask
// it with the same control, so the chip lives here and `ProjectSourceMenu` — the
// searchable body it opens — stays exactly where it was, beside it.
//
// New chat's behaviour is unchanged by the move: same chip, same menu, same
// clone handling, same recents.
//
// The chip WEARS THE PROJECT'S COLOUR (owner ruling 2026-09-09, backlog item
// `one-colour-per-project-on-the-folder-glyph`, decision 7). The owner's
// complaint was "I keep opening up a new chat and forgetting to pick the
// project", and the fix is that a chosen project and no project stop looking
// alike: a chosen one is a solid folder in its own hue, and no project at all
// is a dashed, colourless folder reading "Choose a project". The colour is on
// the glyph and nowhere else on the line — decision 1 — so there is no tinted
// pill and no dot, and there is deliberately no hint text under the chip
// (owner: the person can figure it out from the composer below).
