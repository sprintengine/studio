// change what they hold, and when a machine SAYS it changed. A machine that
// is asleep is never dialled: its last rows stay on screen dimmed, and the
// next reachability event that says it answered is what reads it again.
//
// The change feed (2026-09-05) replaced the thirty-second timer. Main holds
// one idle socket to each paired machine, on which that machine says its
// workspace or conversation list moved, and the band re-reads on that: the
// server owns the state, the client subscribes. The timer
// that remains is a slow fallback for a feed a machine could not open.
//
// A push re-reads only what it names: a conversation push re-lists the
// machine's chats, a workspace push re-browses it. A window
// nobody can see does not re-read at all; it remembers what changed and
// reads once when it is shown again.
