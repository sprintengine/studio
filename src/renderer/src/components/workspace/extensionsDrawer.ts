// What the Extensions drawer IS, as data (Extensions drawer ruling, 2026-09-05).
//
// THREE built-in rows, in a fixed order the owner ruled:
//
//   Design · Plugins · Skills
//
// (Agent CLIs was a fourth until 2026-09-25, when the owner moved them to
// Settings ▸ Agents: that list already showed every CLI per machine with its
// install and update, and two lists of one thing drift.)
//
// Installed module doors follow these three in stable registry order; the
// renderer-side resolver owns those because this file is deliberately a pure
// leaf with no live registry. Registry `order` does not reorder the built-ins.
// The earlier cut sorted doors and modal
// surfaces together by their declared `order`, which meant the column a person
// reads top to bottom was arranged by whichever numbers modules happened to
// claim, and any module registered later could push Design down it. The order
// of the product's parts is a ruling; the list below is that ruling, and each
// entry names only WHERE its row comes from — the owning module still supplies
// the label, the glyph and what opening the row does.
//
// A leaf: pure data plus two predicates, no React and no store, so the drawer
// that RENDERS the rows (ExtensionsRail) and the store action that has to know
// which surfaces BELONG to the drawer (settingsSlice.openGlobalSurface) can
// share one answer instead of keeping two lists that drift.

//             status dot and open behaviour.
//   surface — a module's door, one row for the whole surface (Design).
//   view    — one of a door's registered `views` (renderer-host): the single
//             `extensions` surface is Plugins and Skills to the person, so it
//             contributes two rows, each with its own label, glyph and way of
//             landing the surface on it.
