// The version-control settings sections, as data (MC-1995). DOM-free and
// component-free so the probe → row mapping is unit-tested without a renderer.
//
// Two things live here, and both exist to stop the sections from drifting into
// fiction:
//
//  1. **The spec table is the row universe.** Sections are built by walking
//     `VERSION_CONTROL_PROVIDER_IDS` (the ids the main-process probe actually
//     answers for) and picking up each id's spec. A forge the product does not
//     integrate has no id, therefore no spec, therefore no row — there is no
//     path here that renders a placeholder or disabled row for something the
//     app cannot detect or talk to.
//  2. **The row view is a closed set of states.** Every probe outcome maps onto
//     exactly one `VersionControlRowView`, so "resolved but not logged in" and
//     "we never got an answer" cannot collapse into the same row as "missing".
