 * every project; that was one more line to read past for chats the person had
 * already called finished, so the rail stopped drawing them and this page
 * holds them instead.
 *
 * Two things to do with one, both the ones the shelf offered: Open reads it
 * (and, as opening any settled chat does, leaves it settled — reading is not
 * activity), and Un-settle puts it back in its project's list.
