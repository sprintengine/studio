  // legal — `hosted-card-feed.ts` blesses it in as many words, "a showcase card
  // can be pure marketing" — and nothing downstream used to agree: the card drew
  // a `Go`, the executor looped over nothing and returned `ok`, and the press
  // produced no toast, no navigation and no error. A button that does nothing at
  // all is the one state the executor's own header says it exists to prevent.
  //
  // The answer taken is option 1: the card draws no button and is a poster. The
  // assertion is at the SURFACE rather than in the parser because the parser is
  // not where the sentence was broken — the row is still a card, and still
  // renders.
