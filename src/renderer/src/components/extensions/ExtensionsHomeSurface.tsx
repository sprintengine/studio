// The Extensions home (the app rail's Extensions glyph, 2026-09-05): the page
// the glyph opens, in the card region, with the Extensions drawer standing
// beside it as the navigation.
//
// A DOOR, not a modal (Extensions drawer ruling, 2026-09-05, Stage 2). It was
// the `marketplace` modal for a few hours on the same day; the modal floated
// over the card region with a scrim, which put a dialog between the person and
// the drawer they had just used. Its id changed with its shape — `marketplace`
// named a browse that does not exist yet, `extensions-home` names the page.
//
// Core, like Settings: this is where the product's own parts are offered, so no
// module may gate it (renderer-host reserves the id; WorkspaceManager resolves
// it from the app itself).
//
// **The body is the card feed, and the tiles are the foot of the page**
// (2026-09-06, epic "Extensions opens on a home page", item 2468). The page's
// first body was the drawer said again as tiles, and that answered *what
// is the studio made of* — which is a question nobody arrives with. The cards
// answer *what could I do*, which is the one they do. So the cards are the
// reason to be here and the tiles are the way off: a search field on the chrome
// row, the grid, then the tiles under a quiet heading.
//
// The tiles themselves are untouched by that move. Same destinations, same
// order, same click — the tiles and the drawer rows are still resolved by ONE
// function (`extensionsDrawerRows.ts`), so a tile cannot open something its row
// does not, and each still carries the sentence saying what that part is for
// and the live count saying how much of it you have.
//
// Three states, and the quiet one is the important one. Loading is a skeleton
// grid. A feed that yields no card this build can draw — no network on a fresh
// profile, or a feed of cards whose artwork ships in a later release — falls
// back to **the tiles alone, with no apology and no notice**: the page is
// simply the page it was yesterday (epic rulings R5 and R6 — no version gating,
// and the page never reports on its own network). The heading over the tiles
// goes with the cards for the same reason, because a heading separates
// something from something else and with no cards there is nothing to separate
// them from.
//
// **The Community "coming soon" block is gone** (owner, 2026-09-06). It promised
// a browse of modules other people have published, with search and one-click
// install, "once the registry scan lands" — and nothing has scheduled that scan.
// A storefront that gives the last third of its page to an empty state
// describing a feature with no owner and no date is worse than one that is
// simply shorter.
//
// This overturns the ruling of 2026-09-05 that put the block here, and it is
// recorded as an overturning because that is what it is: item 2468 removed the
// block as a side effect and was reverted for exactly the reason that retiring
// it was not that item's call to make. It is this one's, and the owner made it.
//
// **Building the browse is not refused — it is unscheduled.** If the registry
// scan lands, the browse returns as its own work rather than as a promise kept
// late (backlog/2026-09-06-the-home-pages-bottom-half.md).
//
// What this page deliberately does NOT carry is the module list: module
// switches live in Settings → Modules, and having them here too put the same
// choice in two shapes on two surfaces (principles, Composition).

// The one glyph that is not a module's: a chevron saying the tile leads
// somewhere. Local because it is this page's own punctuation rather than a
// surface's identity, which is what surfaceGlyphs.tsx holds.

            breakpoint is the region and never the viewport.

            `auto-fit` was here until 2026-09-06 and cannot be told to stop at a
            count. With five tiles it happened to resolve to five; item 2470 made
            it six, and five-across left Agent CLIs alone on a second row against
            four columns of whitespace. The tile's own note asks the row to read
            "as one control repeated rather than five cards that happen to be
            adjacent", and an orphan is exactly what that forbids. 1 / 2 / 3 / 6

            utility written on the same element resolves against the nearest
            ancestor container instead — an ancestor this page does not have, and
            the grid silently stays at one column. `CardGrid` above is the
