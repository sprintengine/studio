// Where the part of a chat nobody has read starts: the "New" divider drawn
// before the first reply the person has not seen, and the place the chat opens
// at when there is one.
//
// What was seen comes from the chat's visit clock (`lastVisitedAt`), which the
// sidebar moves forward while the chat is in front (`useVisitStamp`). Opening
// a chat moves it at once, so the clock as it stood just before is taken here
// first (`noteChatOpened`) and held until the person leaves the chat. It is
// said as the chat is made active (`setActiveWorkspace`), before anything is
// drawn, so a chat whose transcript is already loaded mounts its list at the
// divider; the visit stamp says it again, to the same effect, for a chat that
// came in front any other way. The divider is placed against that
// reading and the moment of opening, never against the live clock, so it
// stays where it was drawn while the agent keeps streaming and does not
// vanish the instant the visit lands.
//
// Mark unread, on any device, moves that clock back to just before the
// chat's latest finish (`conversation.mark_unread`), so the next opening
// reads its latest reply as the first unseen one; nothing here keeps a mark
// of its own. The opening is this window's: each has its own chat in front.

 * The row the "New" divider goes above, or null for none.

 * Only an agent's reply can be new. The person's own messages are never the
 * start of what they have not read, and the compaction marker, decision
 * records and the live status line are the view's furniture. A reply is a
 * whole row — its steps folded under it — so the divider lands at a reply's
 * start, never inside its work.
 *
 * A reply is unseen when it finished after the visit clock, or, still
 * streaming when the chat was opened, began after it: one already under way
 * when the person last looked is one they watched begin, and a divider above
 * it after a glance elsewhere would send them back over what they just read. A reply that began
 * after the chat was opened is being watched as it arrives, so the divider
 * never moves on to it. With nothing seen from an agent above the first
 * unseen reply there is no divider at all: the whole chat is new — one started
 * and left before it answered, or never opened — and a "New" above all of it
 * says nothing. Marked unread, the clock stands just before the latest
 * finish, so that is the reply the divider goes above.
 *
 * A context compaction that happened inside the unseen reply's turn sits just
 * above it, and the divider goes above that too, so the two seams read in the
 * order things happened.
 *
 * Only the loaded part of a long chat is in `rows`. With older history above
 * it (`historyAbove`), a first loaded reply that is unseen is not the whole
 * chat being new — the reader may well have seen what came before — so the
 * divider goes above it, at the top of what is loaded. The view pages back
 * first, a bounded few pages, to find the reply that was seen
 * (`unseenFromTheTop`).
