// What the chat's process still runs after its turn ended, as one row of the
// composer tray: "Waiting on monitor: CI checks", "Running: npm run dev". A
// monitor wakes the agent when it has something to say, so the chat is not
// done and the row wears the working mark; a shell the agent left running
// (a dev server) is not work it will come back to, so that row is quiet and
// wears the command mark the transcript draws for a shell step. Stop ends
// all of it: the chat's Stop between turns, for what the turn left running.
