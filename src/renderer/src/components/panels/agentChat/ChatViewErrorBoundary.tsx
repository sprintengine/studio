// The chat view's own error boundary. A chat renders whatever its agent and
// its transport hand it: a malformed reply, an event of a shape nobody
// expected, a lazy chunk that failed to load. Any of those throwing during
// render used to unmount everything up to the root and leave a blank window.
// Here the failure stays in the chat's pane: it says the chat stopped, that
// nothing else did, and offers to draw the chat again from what the runtime
// holds, which is the same as reopening it.
//
// A chat's code arrives as a lazy chunk, and `React.lazy` keeps the first
// answer to its import, a failed one included, so drawing it again would only
// throw the same failure. The chat view is loaded through `reloadableLazy`,
// whose failed import Reload chat starts afresh, and a failure that is a
// chunk that would not load also offers to reload the window, which fetches
// every chunk again.
