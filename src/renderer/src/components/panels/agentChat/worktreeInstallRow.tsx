// The chat's worktree installing its dependencies, said in the composer's
// tray while it runs (main's worktree-pool/dependency-install.ts).
//
// A chat started from outside a window — a paired device's New chat,
// `conversation.create` — is made while its worktree's install runs, and its
// first message waits for the install. Without this the chat would sit with
// no message and no reason. A window's own New chat waits for the install
// before the chat exists, so for it the row is the toast's echo at most.
//
// Matched by path: the install is the worktree's, and the chat works in it.
// Gone once the install ends; how it ended is the toast's and the bell's.
