// The Changes list: a commit checklist composed from the kit (epic
// `git-commit-window`, T5; mockup 2522 panel 1).
//
// ONE KEYBOARD OWNER, ONE LISTBOX PER GROUP. The outer element is the walk: it
// carries `tabIndex=0`, drives the cursor with `aria-activedescendant` across
// every group, and owns Space (tick) and Enter (open). Four hundred rows must
// not be four hundred tab stops, which is why `check-row`'s box is a drawing
// rather than an input and why the row is a `<div role="option">` rather than a
// button.
//
// What the outer element is NOT is the listbox. It used to be, and a listbox
// may own nothing but `option`s — while the group bands standing between the
// runs of rows are three real controls each (a chevron `<button>`, a real
// `<input type="checkbox">`, a kebab `<button>`), which `aria-required-children`
// rejects outright. So the bands sit OUTSIDE every listbox, each group's rows
// are their own `role="listbox"`, and the outer element is a `role="group"` —
// a role that supports `aria-activedescendant`, which is what lets one walk
// span all of them. The band's controls stay real, focusable controls, exactly
// as `group-header` specifies: they are per-GROUP, not per-row, so they cost a
// handful of tab stops rather than four hundred. The ruling is recorded in
// design-system/components/check-row/component.md and group-header/component.md.
//
// TWO QUESTIONS, KEPT APART. The tick is a value the row carries — it IS the
// index — and the fill and edge are where the person is. Clicking the box ticks
// without picking (the box stops the click); clicking the row picks without
// ticking. Everything below follows from that one sentence.
//
// GROUPS, PLURAL, AND IT DOES NOT KNOW WHICH. This renders whatever
// `buildGitChangeGroups` hands it — a changelist, a directory, the untracked
// files, one flat list — as a header, the region it folds, and the cap notice.
// T6 added three kinds and changed nothing here except the chip on the band and
// the band's own menu, which is the point of having taken an array in T5.
//
// A PARTIAL ROW IS A DIFFERENT ROW ABOUT THE SAME FILE. Agent changelists let a
// list own hunks of a file that lives in another list, and that draws a second
// row — same filename, same directory, a `partial` micro-chip, and a `key` that
// is not the path. Everything the list keys on is `row.key` for exactly that
// reason; the chip is the visible half and the row's name carries the sentence,
// because a chip is a drawing and the box under it does something different
// here from what every other box in the panel does.
//
// THE LIST OWNS FOUR MORE KEYS. Space ticks and Enter opens, as before; ⌘↓
// opens the file in an editor, F2 edits the changelist the cursor's row sits
// in, ⌫ deletes the selected files from disk, and ⌥⌘A adds an untracked one to
// git. They live here rather than in the command registry because they are only
// meaningful with this list focused — and because the menu may only carry a
// shortcut hint for a key that works with the menu closed, which these do.
