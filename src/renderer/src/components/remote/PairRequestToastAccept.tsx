// Answering a pair request from the toast it arrives in (owner ruling
// 2026-09-05, recorded in design-system/components/toast/component.md): the
// code field and the two answers, nothing else. The old toast only pointed
// at the Remote glyph — a person at the machine, watching the asking screen,
// had to go somewhere else to type the digits it was showing.
//
// Allow here grants exactly what the asking machine ASKED FOR
// (`requestedScopes`, remote-settings-rebuild). It used to grant a house
// default with the terminal tier stripped out, which meant a machine that asked
// to watch your chats was silently paired without the scope that shows them and
// nobody was told — the same bug in one click that the old Pair a device button
// had in another. The card in the Remote popover remains the surface that
// CHANGES the set; this one answers the question as it was put.
