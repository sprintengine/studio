// What a palette result SOURCE is, so that adding one is not editing an
// 800-line component.
//
// CommandPalette grew six hardcoded groups, one bespoke async path (ripgrep,
// with its own debounce, its own sequence guard and its own cancel), and a
// second, differently-shaped async path for skills that had neither. A third
// source — every skill and plugin in every configured source — could not be
// added to that without a fourth shape. So the shape is named once here, and
// the three real sources are its three implementations:
//
//   • the disk provider  — asks the main process per keystroke, debounced,
//     superseded runs discarded, the ripgrep child cancelled;
//   • the skills provider — warms the installed inventory once when the
//     palette opens, then filters it in memory per keystroke;
//   • the extensions provider — the same, over every source's cached scan and
//     the first-party registry.
//
// Nothing here renders. The palette renders `PaletteCommand`s; this module
// decides when to ask for them, which run wins, and who says "Searching…".
