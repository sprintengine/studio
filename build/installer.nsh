; Custom NSIS include for the Windows installer (package.json `build.nsis.include`).
;
; electron-builder places this file in the script header, after its command-line
; flag macros (${isUpdated}, ${isForceRun}, ${isForAllUsers}) and before its own
; templates, and calls the macros below from fixed points in them:
;
;   preInit       top of .onInit, before the one-instance mutex (installer.nsi)
;   customInit    end of .onInit, after initMultiUser has chosen $INSTDIR (installer.nsi)
;   customInstall end of the install section, after files, registry and shortcuts (installSection.nsh)
;   customUnInit  end of un.onInit, after initMultiUser (uninstaller.nsh)
;
; What it is for: an update installs over the installation that is running,
; wherever that is (owner ruling 2026-09-24). The installer is one-click and
; per-user (`oneClick: true, perMachine: false`), and on its own it only knows a
; per-user installation: multiUser.nsh's setInstallModePerUser reads
; InstallLocation from HKCU and otherwise picks %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs. Stable
; 0.4.0 to 0.6.0 shipped the assisted installer, which could also install for all
; users (Program Files, recorded in HKLM) or into a folder of the person's
; choosing. Updating one of those with the stock one-click installer puts a
; second copy under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs, and the copy the shortcuts start
; never updates.
;
; So, only when the installer runs as an update (`--updated`):
;
;  1. Find the folder to install into. In order: the /D= the app passed (this
;     build's app always does); else the folder of the process that started the
;     installer, when that process is the app itself (an older build, which
;     passes no folder); else the registry, HKCU first, then HKLM.
;  2. If that folder is the one HKLM records, this is an all-users
;     installation: switch to all-users mode (SetShellVarContext all, so
;     SHELL_CONTEXT is HKLM and the shortcuts are the common ones) and, when not
;     already elevated, relaunch elevated once for this update.
;  3. The uninstaller written into an all-users installation is this per-user
;     build's, and its un.onInit would otherwise look in HKCU. Its uninstall
;     string says /allusers (registryAddInstallInfo writes that when
;     $installMode is "all"), so customUnInit switches it to all-users mode too.
;
; makensis runs with -WX here (warnings are errors), so every Var below is used
; in the build that declares it, and there are no Functions (an unreferenced
; Function is a warning).
