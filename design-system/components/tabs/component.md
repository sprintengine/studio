# Tabs

The view switcher inside a panel: a row of peers, exactly one active, the
active one marked by an accent hairline underline and an ink lift — never an
accent fill. Extracted from the shipped `Tabs` primitive
(`src/renderer/src/components/ui/Tabs.tsx`), whose underline treatment the
conformance tests lock: the only elements allowed to carry accent fill are
1px hairlines.

Use tabs when the choices are views of the same content region. Use a
segmented control when they are values of a setting, and the context rail
when they are destinations.

## Anatomy

| Part | Class | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Scroller | `.ds-tabs-scroller` | no — the overflow wrapper: scrolls sideways, never draws a scrollbar, fades each overflowing edge |
| Tab list | `.ds-tabs` | yes — `role="tablist"` with an `aria-label`, one bottom hairline |
| Tab | `.ds-tab` | yes — `role="tab"` buttons, `font.size.meta` |
| Icon | `.ds-tab-icon` | no — a leading glyph, `aria-hidden` |
| Count | `.ds-tab-count` | no — canonical count, tabular, `font.size.micro` |
| Badge | `.ds-tab-badge` | no — the `badge` corner count: what is WAITING in this tab. Needs `.ds-tab--badged` on the tab for its room |
| Underline | `.ds-tab-underline` | yes — the 1px active marker, `aria-hidden` |
| Panel | `.ds-tab-panel` | yes — `role="tabpanel"`, a focusable scroll region |

Tabs sit `size.control.sm` (30px) tall at `space.lg` inline padding, spaced
by `space.3xs`. Each tab overlaps the row's hairline by 1px so the active
underline draws **on** the border, not above it — one line, two meanings.
The underline is inset `space.sm` from each end of its tab: it marks the
label, not the hit area.

## Variants

- **Default** — the row draws its own `border.subtle`-weight structure with a
  `border.default` hairline.
- **`--borderless`** — no hairline; a parent container owns the row's border.
  Needed when the tab row shares its band with trailing inline controls —
  one chrome band, one line. Its tabs also drop the 1px overlap: the line they
  would reach for is a band they are passengers in, and the band's overflow
  container clips the overhang — which is the pixel the active underline lives
  in, so the overlap costs a borderless strip its selection marker entirely.
- **`--badged`** — the tab reserves `space.3xl` of trailing room and docks a
  `badge` count in its top-right: how many things inside want the person. See
  "A count on a tab is not a badge on a tab" below. Never on `--icon-only`, and
  never on a closable tab — that tab's trailing padding is already spoken for by
  its close glyph, and two things docked in one corner is neither of them.
- **`--icon-only`** — each tab renders its glyph alone on a
  `size.control.sm` square, the glyph steps up to `icon.size.sm`, and the
  label becomes the tab's accessible name *and* its tooltip. For a strip on a
  band that cannot spend width on words — a panel's own chrome row, shared
  with that panel's actions. Every item must carry an icon.

## States

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Rest | `text.muted`, transparent underline |
| Hover | Ink lifts to `text.primary`. No background — the underline idiom marks tabs, not a fill |
| Active | `text.primary` + the accent hairline underline. Never an accent fill or a pill |
| Focus-visible | `focus.ring` |
| Disabled | `opacity: 0.5`, `cursor: not-allowed` |

## Usage

**The underline is the whole treatment.** An active tab is an ink lift plus a
1px accent line. A filled tab, a tinted pill, or a raised card is a second
accent idiom and a reject-on-sight.

**Selection follows focus.** Arrow keys move focus *and* activate: Left/Right
step through enabled tabs with wraparound, Home/End jump to the ends. This is
the correct model when switching panels is cheap; if a panel is expensive to
mount, keep roving focus but activate on Enter/Space instead — pick one model
per product and hold to it.

**Roving tabindex.** Exactly one tab is in the tab order at any time — the
active one. Tab from the active tab lands in the panel, not on the next tab.

**Counts are canonical.** A count on a tab is the count of that view. Do not
repeat it inside the panel where the two could disagree.

**A count on a tab is not a badge on a tab** (2026-09-10). They are two
different questions and they get two different places:

- the **count** is *how many things are in here*. It rides beside the label, in
  the reading line, because it is part of what the tab says.
- the **badge** is *how many of them want you* — updates waiting, work blocked
  on an answer. It sits above the words, top-right, because it is not part of
  them. It is the same pip the app rail's squares wear, so "there is news here"
  is one drawing wherever the product says it.

A tab can carry both, and a tab reading "SprintEngine Studio 10 ③" is saying
two true things. What it must not do is draw the badge at zero: a counter
reading "0" is a counter spent saying there is no news. Nor may a tab spend
the badge on a fact it cannot count — where a source is known to have moved on
but no per-item answer exists yet, that is a mark (a glyph), not a number, and
the two never show together on one tab.

**A badged tab names itself.** The counter is a named live region — it has to
be, the number moves while the reader is elsewhere — and a named child inside a
button joins that button's name-from-contents, so the tab announces as "Studio:
3 updates available Studio 10". Give a badged tab an explicit accessible name:
an explicit name wins over name-from-contents, the tab says its piece once, and
the counter goes on announcing its own changes.

**A badge on a tab is docked, not overhung.** The `badge` component's `--corner`
mode hangs the counter outside its trigger; outside a tab is the scroller's
clip, which is the same pixel-eating that costs a borderless strip its
underline. `--badged` reserves room and the badge sits inside it — same corner,
drawn where it survives, and with no keyline, since it covers the band rather
than a glyph.

**An icon-only tab keeps its name, it just stops drawing it.** The label
becomes `aria-label` and the tooltip, so the word is one hover or one focus
away and unchanged for assistive tech. Dropping the label without either is a
blank button, and it is the only thing this variant can get wrong. It draws no
count at all, and no badge either: a number pinned to a 30px glyph covers the
mark it is badging as soon as it reaches two digits, and five badged glyphs is a
row of alarms. Put the count in the tooltip beside the name ("Log · 3,057
commits").

**A strip that can outgrow its band scrolls, it does not squeeze.** Wrap it in
`.ds-tabs-scroller`: tabs stay `shrink-0`, the row scrolls sideways, and the
overflowing edges fade. Never a scrollbar — under a 36px band it is a second
horizontal line and a third of the row's height. The host routes a plain
vertical wheel to `scrollLeft`, because a horizontal row has no vertical axis
to spend that gesture on.

**The panel is a tab stop.** It is usually a scroll container, so it takes
`tabindex="0"` — otherwise keyboard users cannot scroll it. Only the active
panel is rendered; inactive panels are unmounted, not hidden.

## Accessibility

- The tablist carries a required `aria-label` naming what the tabs switch
  ("Inbox views"). Tabs are `<button role="tab">` with `aria-selected` and
  `aria-controls` pointing at their panel's `id`.
- The panel carries `role="tabpanel"` and `aria-labelledby` pointing back at
  its tab, so its accessible name is the tab's label.
- The panel's focus indicator is the ring drawn **inward** (a negative
  `focus.ring-offset`): it sits at the edge of a scrolling region, where an
  outward ring is clipped. Without it a focusable panel falls back to the UA
  outline — the one treatment the system cannot theme.
- Icons on tabs are `aria-hidden`; the label carries the name. On the
  `--icon-only` variant the glyph stays `aria-hidden` and the label moves to
  the tab's `aria-label`, so the accessible name is identical in both
  variants — the tooltip is the sighted user's version of the same string,
  and it opens on focus as well as hover.
- An icon-only tab's count lives in its tooltip and its `aria-label`, not in a
  badge, so the number is announced once and read once.
- Disabled tabs keep their label readable (`opacity`, not an ink swap to
  `text.disabled` alone) and are skipped by arrow navigation.

## Known drift

All in `src/renderer/src/components/ui/Tabs.tsx`:

- ~~Tabs render 32px tall (`h-8`); the control ramp has no 32px step. Canon is
  `size.control.sm` (30px) — the default for a labeled control.~~ **Resolved
  2026-09-02:** `h-control-sm`.
- ~~Tab icons render at 14px (`h-3.5`); the icon ramp has no 14px step. Canon
  is `icon.size.xs` (13px).~~ **Resolved 2026-09-02:** `size-icon-xs`.
- ~~Disabled tabs ship `opacity-45`; the system-wide disabled treatment
  (list-row, task-card) is 0.5.~~ **Resolved 2026-09-02:** `disabled:opacity-50`,
  the row-family value — a tab is a row in a strip, not a button.

## Shipped implementation

`src/renderer/src/components/ui/Tabs.tsx`, exporting `Tabs` (the strip, with
the `iconOnly` prop and the per-item `tooltip`), `TabPanel` (the panel bound to
it by `aria-controls` / `aria-labelledby`), and `TabsScroller` (the overflow
wrapper — it owns the wheel routing and measures which edges actually overflow
before it fades them).
