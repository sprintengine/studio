// The pull requests a Studio's conversations opened. A conversation owns a
// pull request when its agent opened it: a create command or tool whose output
// named it, or the agent saying so through the Studio's MCP gateway. A Studio
// reads each one's state from its host (GitHub, through `gh`) and watches the
// open ones until they land; one on another forge is shown as opened. A client
// only displays them: a sidebar's mark, a tooltip, a peek's menu.
//
// Two ways to ask, by workspace (every conversation in it, and every agent it
// ever had) and by conversation (one agent). `pullRequests.changed` names what
// moved, never the lists themselves, so a client asks again for what it is
// showing. A Studio with no way to ask its host (no `gh`, or not signed in)
// answers with what it last read and never fails for it.
//
// `pullRequests.noteToolCall` and `pullRequests.noteWork` are for a client that
// runs agents the Studio does not: the desktop's terminal agents. The first
// forwards a tool call such an agent made, which the Studio reads exactly as
// it reads its own chats' calls; the second says which checkout the agent is
// in, which decides which of its pull requests are from the branch it is on.
//
// Owners only in this version, behind the `pull-requests` capability,
// `pullRequests.noteToolCall` behind `pull-request-tool-calls`, and
// `pullRequests.link` (an owner that opened a pull request for a conversation)
// behind `pull-request-link`.
