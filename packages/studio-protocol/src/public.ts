// The package's entry: the Studio protocol, and the conversation contract it
// carries.
//
// Everything `@sprintengine/conversation-protocol` exports is re-exported
// here, so a client depends on this one package. The conversation package
// stays what it is — the conversation lane on its own, which the phone app
// carries byte for byte — and this one adds the connection around it.
