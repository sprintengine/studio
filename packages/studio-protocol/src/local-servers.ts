// The local servers a Studio's conversations started: a dev server, a preview,
// anything an agent ran that a person may want to open. An agent says so
// through the Studio's MCP gateway (`local_server.link`), with the URL and,
// when it has one, the command that starts it. The Studio checks each one
// where its agents run (is something accepting connections on its port?), so
// a client shows "Running" or "Stopped" and only displays what it is told.
//
// A server a person asks to run again is started by the Studio itself, from
// the command and folder the agent gave, and only that run can be stopped
// from a client: a server an agent started belongs to the agent's process,
// and the Studio does not reach into it.
//
// Two ways to ask, as for pull requests: by workspace (every conversation in
// it) and by conversation (one agent). `localServers.changed` names what
// moved, never the lists themselves, so a client asks again for what it is
// showing.
//
// Owners only in this version, behind the `local-servers` capability.
