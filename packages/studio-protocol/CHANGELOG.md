# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Client tools** (`client-tools`): `tools.offer`, `withdraw`, `focus`,
  `catalog`, `grants` and `grant`, the `tools.catalog` stream, the `call` /
  `cancel` server frames and `reply` / `progress` client frames, the
  `tools:offer` scope, `STUDIO_TOOL_LIMITS` and the validators
  (`parseStudioToolsetOffer`, `parseStudioToolResult`, …).
- **Files by root** (`files-write`, owners): `files.roots`, `list`, `read`,
  `write`, `remove`, `stat` with a `root`, the `files.watch` stream, the
  `files:write` scope, and `uploads.begin { purpose: 'file' }`.
- `hello.client.kind` and `hello.client.instanceId`; the `reserved_name`,
  `name_taken` and `not_offered` codes.
- `worktree` among `STUDIO_RESERVED_TOOLSET_NAMES`: the worktree pool's
  `worktree.lease` and `worktree.release`, which a Studio's shell offers.

- **The chat surface** (`chat.ts`): `session.*`, `uploads.*` (with
  `uploads.discard`), the
  conversation's `revert`, `rewind`, `fork`, `attachment`, `planDocument` and
  `commands` with its `conversation.commands` stream, `providers.*`, `files.*`
  and `workspaces.list`; their param validators (`parseStudioChatParams`) and
  limits; the scopes `providers:read`, `files:read` and `workspaces:read`; and
  the capabilities in `STUDIO_CHAT_CAPABILITIES`. Every chat method is an
  owner's only (`StudioMethodSpec.owner`, refused `owner_required`).
- **Folder keys.** A conversation key may carry `workspaceRoot`, an owner's
  only, behind `conversation-folders` (`key.ts`).
- **Push streams.** `{ t: 'push', sub, payload }` for a stream with no cursor.
- **`server.ping`**, answered at once, for a client's liveness check.
- **Error ids.** A refusal's error and a `subFailed` frame may carry `errorId`.
- **`command_id_conflict`**, for a command id reused for a different command.

## 0.1.0

The first version: what Studio serves on its owner socket.

### Added

- **The envelope.** `hello` / `welcome` / `bye`, requests answered under their
  id (`res`), streams keyed by subscription (`sub`, `frame`, `subFailed`,
  `unsub`) and chunking for frames over `STUDIO_MAX_FRAME_BYTES`, with their
  validators for both ends (`parseStudioClientFrame`,
  `parseStudioServerFrame`) and a chunk assembler for clients.
- **The handshake.** `STUDIO_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (1) and its window,
  `checkStudioProtocolVersion`, and the Studio capabilities `conversations`,
  `conversation-create` and `local-pairing`. The conversation contract's
  `hello` answer is nested in the `welcome` unchanged.
- **Scopes and grants.** `conversation:read`, `conversation:operate` and
  `conversation:create`, and a grant's permission `ceiling`.
- **The method table.** `STUDIO_METHODS` and `STUDIO_TOPICS`, each naming its
  scope, for the `server` and `conversation` namespaces; params validated by
  `parseStudioMethodParams`, a command's through the conversation lane's own
  validator.
- **Discovery.** The `server.json` a running Studio writes beside its socket.
- **The conversation contract**, re-exported from
  `@sprintengine/conversation-protocol`, which this package depends on.
