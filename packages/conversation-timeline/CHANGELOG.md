# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

### Added

- The projection, incremental projection and timeline Studio's chat view
  draws from, moved here unchanged so the app and other views share one
  implementation.
- `createConversationFollower`: follow one conversation over a Studio
  connection and read it as rows, with paging to earlier turns.
- `checkConversationTimelineProtocol`: the conversation protocol window the
  package reads, checked against a Studio's welcome.
