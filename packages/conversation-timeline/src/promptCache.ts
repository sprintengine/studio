// A session's prompt cache, as the agent CLI last reported it.
//
// The API keeps a conversation's prefix cached for a fixed lifetime after the
// last request that wrote or read it: five minutes by default, an hour when
// asked for (Claude Code asks for an hour on a Pro or Max subscription). Inside
// that window the next message re-reads the whole conversation at a tenth of
// the input price or less; past it, the next message writes the whole
// conversation to the cache again at full price or more. For a long session
// that is hundreds of thousands of tokens, so an idle session's cache is worth
// showing — and worth compacting before it goes cold.
//
// Two sources fill it:
//   * a terminal agent's own status line: Claude Code hands its status-line
//     command a `prompt_cache` object (warm, ttl, expires_at, and the tokens a
//     cold resume re-caches), which the status-line forwarder passes on;
//   * a chat agent's provider, which reads each API request's usage as it
//     starts: its size, and whether the cache it wrote lives for five minutes
//     or an hour.
//
// Every surface derives warm / expiring / cold from this reading and a clock,
// so a session whose process has since gone quiet — suspended, or parked
// across a restart — still goes cold on time.
