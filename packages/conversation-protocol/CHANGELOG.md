# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **A queued message is held by the desktop the chat runs on.**
  `CONVERSATION_QUEUED_SENDS_CAPABILITY` (`conversation-queued-sends`) names a
  desktop that holds a message queued while a chat is mid-turn and sends it
  when the turn ends, so the device that typed it may sleep or close
  meanwhile. `send` takes `queue: true` (its words alone: never beside
  `uploadIds`), answered once the message is held; the `cancelQueued` command
  (`queuedId`) takes one back; the `watchQueued` request
  (`ConversationWatchQueuedRequest`) has the desktop send `queued` frames
  (`ConversationQueuedFrame`, each message a `ConversationQueuedMessage` of
  `id`, `text`, `createdAt` and an optional `failure`, at most
  `CONVERSATION_MAX_QUEUED_MESSAGES`) for the chat followed, now and on every
  change. `parseConversationClientMessage` reads all three and
  `parseConversationServerFrame` reads the frame, leaving out a message it
  cannot read. A desktop without the capability drops `queue`, so a send made
  mid-turn is refused `busy` as before, and answers the command and the
  request under their ids; it never sends a `queued` frame to a client that
  did not ask. The pinned files are unchanged.

- **A listed chat previews its agent's last reply.** `lastAssistantText` is
  an optional member of `ConversationThread`: the opening of the reply as
  written, at most `CONVERSATION_MAX_REPLY_PREVIEW` (240) characters, the line
  the desktop's own sidebar shows under the chat's title. Absent for a chat
  whose agent has not answered since the person last wrote.
  `parseConversationServerFrame` keeps it when it is text with words in it,
  cuts one past the cap, and leaves out anything else. The pinned files are
  unchanged.

- **A listed chat says when it was last marked unread.** `visitRewoundAt` is
  an optional member of `ConversationThread`, beside `lastVisitedAt`, kept by
  `parseConversationServerFrame` when it is a time and left out otherwise. A
  client keeping visit readings of its own takes the listed `lastVisitedAt`
  over any it took before this stamp. The pinned files are unchanged.

- **A message the desktop sent a chat itself says so.** `origin` is an
  optional member of the `user_message` payload,
  `ConversationMessageOrigin` (`{ kind: 'studio', reason? }`, the reason
  `agent-notice` or `usage-resume`), read by `readConversationMessageOrigin`.
  A message without one is the person's, so every transcript written before
  reads as it did, and a reader that does not know the member shows the
  message as the person's. The pinned files are unchanged.

- **A listed chat says where it stands in the desktop's own list.**
  `chatTitle` (the chat's title as the desktop's sidebar shows it),
  `lastUserMessageAt`, `lastTurnEndedAt` and `lastVisitedAt` are optional
  members of `ConversationThread`, kept by `parseConversationServerFrame` when
  readable and left out otherwise. `CONVERSATION_LIFECYCLE_CAPABILITY`
  (`conversation-lifecycle`) names a desktop that sends them, leaves settled
  chats out of the list, orders it as its sidebar does, and serves the
  `conversation.settle` and `conversation.visit` tools. The pinned files are
  unchanged.

- **`usage_updated` says how full the context window is.** `contextWindow`
  (the model's window, in tokens) and `contextUsed` (the tokens in it now:
  the latest request's size, not a sum) are reported by Claude Code and Codex
  chats as well as ACP agents, which already sent them. Both are optional
  payload members, so a reader that does not know them skips them, and the
  wire validator passes them through. The pinned files are unchanged.
- **A listed chat names its machine and its pull requests.** `host`
  (`ConversationWireHost`: `id`, `kind`, `label`, `color`) and `pullRequests`
  (`ConversationWirePullRequest`: `number`, `state`, `url`, `title`, at most
  `CONVERSATION_MAX_PULL_REQUESTS`) are optional members of
  `ConversationThread`, kept by `parseConversationServerFrame` and validated
  on their own by `parseConversationWireHost` and
  `parseConversationWirePullRequests`. An unreadable one is left out and the
  row kept. The pinned files are unchanged.
- **`turn_retrying`**, an event for a model call the provider will try
  again, with `ConversationTurnRetryingPayload` (`attempt`, `maxAttempts`,
  `retryInMs`, and the failure's `error` category and HTTP `status`). Until
  now a turn that kept failing and retrying showed nothing until the provider
  gave up. A client that does not know the type skips it.
- **The tool presentation is public.** `presentToolItem`, `toolActionVerb`
  and `summarizeToolGroup` (with `PresentableTool` and `ToolPresentation`)
  are exported from the entry, for views that word a tool step as Studio
  does. The pinned files are unchanged.

## 0.2.0

The package becomes the one conversation contract: what the tailnet lane, the
module SDK and the desktop's own chat view all speak.

### Added

- **The package entry is `public.ts`.** It publishes the first version's
  frames and helpers (`index.ts`, unchanged byte for byte, because the phone
  app carries those files under a shared pin), the client-side server-frame
  validator (`parseConversationServerFrame`, `parseConversationWireEvent`),
  which the entry did not export before, and everything below.
- **The event layer.** `ConversationEvent`, `ConversationEventType` with its
  value list `CONVERSATION_EVENT_TYPES` and `isConversationEventType`,
  `ConversationSessionStatus`, the payload types (`tool_started`,
  `tool_output`, `subagent_status`, `subagent_message`, `approval_requested`,
  `approval_resolved`), `ConversationQuestion`, `ConversationPage`, the stream
  frames a follower receives (`ConversationStreamFrame`) and the resume
  cursor (`ConversationCursor`). These were the desktop's own declarations;
  the desktop now imports them from here.
- **The command vocabulary.** `ConversationCommand` extends the wire's
  commands with `resolvePlan` (`approve` or `reject`, behind
  `conversation-plans`) and a `permissionMode` on `setPermissionPreset`
  (behind `conversation-cli-permission-modes`); `ConversationRequestDecision`
  names the three answers a client may give a tool request and never a
  permanent rule. `parseConversationClientMessage` and
  `explainRejectedConversationMessage` read the full contract and read every
  first-version frame exactly as `parseConversationClientFrame` does.
- **Create requests.** `ConversationCreateRequest`, with `allowedTools`, and
  its validator `parseConversationCreateRequest`.
- **The handshake.** `CONVERSATION_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (1) and
  `CONVERSATION_PROTOCOL_MIN_SUPPORTED`, the `hello` request and its answer
  (`parseConversationHelloAnswer`), `checkConversationProtocolVersion`, and
  `CONVERSATION_CAPABILITIES`, every capability name the lane has shipped.
- **Listed modes.** `ConversationThread` is a listed thread with its
  `permissionMode` and `capabilities.permissionModes`, which
  `parseConversationServerFrame` now keeps.
- **Publishable.** `publishConfig`, `repository` and this changelog. Publishing
  is a separate release step.

## 0.1.0

The direct conversation lane on the tailnet gateway: frames, the client-frame
validator, tool classification and presentation.
