// without it refuses an unknown kind as `unsupported_command` and drops an
// unknown member, which is the fallback each extension below is shaped for.

/**
 * An answer to a `tool` permission request: allow this request `once`, allow
 * requests of its kind for the rest of the `conversation`, or `deny` it. A
 * rule that outlives the conversation is the person's to make on the desktop
 * itself, and no client can choose one.

 * A command, from the full contract. Beyond the wire's own:
 *
 * - `setPermissionPreset` may name the CLI's own `permissionMode` at that
 *   preset (Claude Code's Accept edits, Codex's Workspace). Needs
 *   `conversation-cli-permission-modes`; a desktop without it ignores the
 *   member and runs the preset's own mode. A mode whose level is not the
 *   preset runs the preset's own as well.
 * - `resolvePlan` answers a `plan` request and only a plan request. Needs
 *   `conversation-plans`; before it, a plan was answered as a `resolveApproval`
 *   (`once` carries it out, `deny` rejects it), which every desktop still takes.
 * - `send` may say `queue`: the desktop holds the message and sends it the
 *   moment the chat's turn ends (at once, if none is running), and answers as
 *   soon as it holds it rather than when a turn ends. A held message is its
 *   words alone, so `queue` never rides beside `uploadIds`. Needs
 *   `conversation-queued-sends`; a desktop without it drops the member, and
 *   a send made while a turn runs is refused `busy`, as every send was.
 * - `cancelQueued` takes back a message the desktop holds (`queued` frames
 *   name each by `id`), refused once it is on its way into the chat. Needs
 *   `conversation-queued-sends` too.
