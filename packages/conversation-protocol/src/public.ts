// `index.ts` and the four files it re-exports are the portable source the
// phone app carries byte-for-byte under a shared SHA-256 pin
// (src/main/automation/tailnet/conversation-protocol.test.ts), so they change
// only in a change made on both sides at once. Everything added since lives
// in files of its own and is published from here, which keeps the pinned
// files as they are while the package grows.
