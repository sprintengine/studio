// The public event layer: what a conversation records, in a vocabulary no
// provider owns. Each provider adapter reads its CLI's own stream (an SDK
// message, an app-server notification, an ACP update) and writes these; the
// provider's own shapes never leave the adapter. Everything that follows a
// conversation — the chat view, a paired device, a module, an embedder — reads
// this layer and nothing under it.
//
// Additive by rule: a client skips an event type, or a payload member, it does
// not know (`parseConversationWireEvent` lets unknown types through for that
// reason), so a new kind or field ships without a version bump.
