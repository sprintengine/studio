# Stateful conversation-provider contract (Claude Agent SDK)

Contract for the conversation providers, reviewed against the runtime on 2026-09-26.

## Problem

For stateless providers, `ConversationRuntime` owns the
chat history (`RuntimeSession.history`), replays `[...history, user]` on every
turn, and treats a provider "session" as nothing more than a namespace for
events. The Claude Agent SDK is the opposite: `query()` with a streaming-input
prompt holds a **long-lived child process** that owns its own history, emits
`SDKMessage`s across turns, supports native `interrupt()`, and persists a
resume cursor (`session_id`) that survives app restarts.

## Adapter contract

One new optional capability on the adapter, discriminated by a `sessions`
field. The stateless shape stays exactly as-is (OpenRouter/mock regression
surface is zero):

```ts
// src/main/providers/conversation-provider-adapter.ts (extracted, main-only)
export type ConversationProviderAdapter = {
  id: string
  displayName?: string
  capabilities?: ConversationCapabilities
  listModels(): string[]
  // 'stateless' (default): runtime replays full history each turn.
  // 'stateful': adapter owns history + resume; runtime must NOT replay.
  sessions?: 'stateless' | 'stateful'
  startSession(input): ConversationProviderEventStream
  sendTurn(input): ConversationProviderEventStream
  resolveApproval(input): ConversationProviderEventStream
  interrupt(input): ConversationProviderEventStream
  stopSession(input): ConversationProviderEventStream
}
```

The method set is unchanged — statefulness changes the _semantics_, not the
shape, so the runtime keeps one code path for event fan-out/persistence:

- `sendTurn` on a stateful adapter receives only the new user `message`
  (runtime skips building `messages: [...history, user]` and skips its own
  history bookkeeping).
- `resolveApproval` resolves a pending in-turn permission callback (the SDK
  `canUseTool` promise) instead of replaying a synthetic follow-up turn; the
  turn then **continues streaming** within the same `sendTurn` event stream.
- `interrupt` maps to the SDK's native `interrupt()`.
- `stopSession` disposes the child process but keeps the resume cursor.

### Runtime branching (conversation-runtime.ts)

- **History**: `if (adapter.sessions !== 'stateful')` guard around history
  replay and history recording. Stateful sessions leave `history` empty.
- **Approvals**: today the runtime pre-allocates one `requestId` per turn and
  flips `awaiting_approval` at end-of-stream. Stateful providers surface
  approvals **mid-stream** (the SDK blocks inside `canUseTool` while the
  stream stays open). The runtime therefore:
  - forwards mid-stream `approval_requested` events as they are emitted
    (fan-out already does this);
  - tracks `session.pendingRequestId` from the event payload (set on
    `approval_requested`, cleared on `approval_resolved`) via a listener in
    the emit path rather than only from `applyTurnState`;
  - `respondToRequest` routes to `adapter.resolveApproval` while the turn is
    still active; for stateless adapters the legacy end-of-stream behavior is
    preserved (guarded by `sessions !== 'stateful'`).
  - `sendTurn` returns when the turn's stream ends (`turn_completed` /
    `turn_failed`), exactly as today; a pending approval keeps the stream
    open, so the existing "await emitAll" model needs no re-architecture.
- **Send-while-awaiting**: unchanged rule (reject sends while
  `pendingRequestId` is set) for both kinds.

### Resume cursor persistence

Stateful adapters need `{ providerSessionId }` durable per (workspace, agent).
The conversation JSONL transcript is already the durable per-agent record, so
the cursor rides it: the adapter emits a `session_started` event whose payload
carries `providerSessionId` (the SDK `session_id` from the `init` system
message, updated on every turn's result message via `session_updated`
payloads). On `startSession`, the runtime reads the tail of the existing
JSONL (if any) for the latest `providerSessionId` and passes it to the adapter
as `input.resumeSessionId`. No new store, no settings-store setter.

"Edit from here" rewinds ride the same cursor. An adapter declaring
`capabilities.rewind` puts a `providerCursor` (`{ sessionId, at }`, `at` being
the newest entry of the provider session's main chain) on each turn end it
emits. `rewindToTurn` walks the transcript back from the chosen user message,
past turns an earlier rewind hid, to the newest turn end carrying one, hands it
to the adapter's `rewind` (null when the message was the first), and writes a
`session_updated` with `rewoundFromSeq` — which hides that message and every
turn after it from the projection — plus `providerSessionId` and
`providerResumeAt`. That event is a resume cursor too: a session started
before the next turn passes `resumeSessionAt`, and the Claude adapter forks the
session there (`resumeSessionAt` with `forkSession`) once, then records the
fork's own id so a later restart does not fork again. Only the child's `init`
names its session: a fork whose point is missing fails with a fresh
`session_id` nobody wrote under, which is ignored; the adapter drops the fork
point and records the session as it was, so the next send resumes it whole.

A steer (`send` with `steer: true`, for an adapter declaring
`capabilities.steer` and implementing `steer`) hands a message to the running
turn without a provider turn of its own. The Claude adapter pushes it into the
child's input stamped with its own uuid; the CLI folds it in at the next tool
round (one `result` naming both uuids) or, with no round left, answers it in an
exchange of its own after the first `result`. The provider's turn ends only on
a `result` once every uuid it sent has been named. The runtime, in its
serialized emission order, writes the running turn's end (`steered: true`,
with the cursor where the message went in when the adapter knows one), the
message, and the next turn's start, and from then on counts every event of the
same stream toward that turn — approvals, tool results, cost and the stream's
own end. Tool streams, checkpoints and idle attention are settled once, at
that real end. "Edit from here" on a steered message without a cursor goes
back before the turn it joined, taking that turn's message out of view too.

"Fork from here" rides the cursor as well, into a new transcript.
`forkAtTurn` reads the parent's visible events (turns a rewind hid stay
behind), cuts them after a reply's turn end or before a user message, and walks
back from the cut as a rewind does to the newest `providerCursor`. It hands the
adapter's optional `fork` the parent's session context, that cursor, whether
the cut lines up with it (`exact`: false when a steer joined the reply, or the
transcript has no record), and whether the provider has seen anything after
the cut (`latest`). The adapter answers the fork's own cursor: the parent's
session at the point (Claude: the turn's last entry, branched with
`resumeSessionAt` and `forkSession` on the fork's first spawn; Codex: the
thread and turn, branched with `thread/fork` and `lastTurnId`), a session it
branched already (an ACP agent's `session/fork`, only at the newest reply), or
null. The copy, renumbered under the new agent id, ends with a
`session_updated` carrying `forkedFrom` and that cursor; `readResumeCursor`
treats it like a rewind's marker. Null with history to carry also writes
`seedFromHistory`, and every start passes `seedFromHistory: true` with
`fallbackHistory`, which the Codex and ACP adapters send ahead of the next
message, until the adapter reports the seed delivered (a `session_updated`
with `historySeeded`, once Codex accepted `turn/start` or the ACP prompt
returned) or a turn of the fork completes. An adapter without `fork` is seeded
when stateful and needs nothing when stateless.

### Provider identity & listing

- Adapter id: `claude-agent`. Registered as a **bundled adapter** in the
  `ConversationRuntime` default adapter list (like `mock-provider`), plus a
  bundled manifest entry so `conversation:providers:list` surfaces it with
  models and `requiresSecret: false`.
- Manifest: new optional `kind: 'cli-agent'` marker on the conversation
  provider manifest (`src/shared/plugin-manifest.ts`) so the renderer can
  show "uses your Claude Code subscription" copy and skip API-key affordances.
- Availability gate: the provider is listed only when the Claude Code CLI
  resolves (same resolution as `terminal-launch.ts`: `appSettings.cliRuntimes`
  command override, else PATH lookup). Models come from a static list of CLI
  model aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, `default`) — the CLI accepts
  aliases and full model ids; no remote catalog call.

### SDK containment

- Exact-pinned `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (no `^`).
- All SDK types stay inside `src/main/providers/claude-agent-provider.ts`.
- New `ConversationEvent` variants stay provider-neutral and live in
  `src/shared/conversation-runtime.ts` (shared never imports main).

### Event mapping (SDKMessage → ConversationEvent)

| SDK                                                | Canonical                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `system/init`                                      | `session_started` payload `{ providerSessionId, model }` |
| `stream_event: content_block_delta text_delta`     | `content_delta`                                          |
| `stream_event: content_block_delta thinking_delta` | `reasoning_delta`                                        |
| `assistant` message `tool_use` blocks              | `tool_started` (name + input summary)                    |
| `user` message `tool_result` blocks                | `tool_output`                                            |
| `system/compact_boundary`                          | `context_compacted` payload `{ trigger, preTokens }`     |
| `result success`                                   | `usage_updated` + `turn_completed`                       |
| `result error*`                                    | `turn_failed`                                            |
| `canUseTool` callback                              | `approval_requested` … `approval_resolved`               |
| rate-limit / auth notices                          | `turn_failed` reason `auth` (v1)                         |

Everything unrecognized is dropped (forward-compatible with SDK churn).

### Capabilities and structured tools

`src/main/providers/conversation-provider-adapter.ts` owns the adapter and stream
types. `src/shared/conversation-runtime.ts` owns `ConversationCapabilities`,
`ConversationToolEvent`, and the detail result discriminated union. Every bundled
adapter declares its capabilities; the runtime includes them and its display name
in the session summary before the first turn. Optional declarations accommodate
legacy adapters. UI controls read capabilities rather than provider identities.

| Capability                                               | Claude Code | API  | Mock   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---- | ------ |
| tools, approvals, questions, planMode, images, subagents | yes         | no   | yes    |
| skills                                                   | native      | none | native |
| interrupt                                                | yes         | yes  | yes    |
| resume                                                   | yes         | no   | no     |
| cost, contextMeter, liveModelSwitch                      | no          | no   | no     |
| reasoningEfforts                                         | null        | null | null   |

Tool starts preserve structured input and a normalized kind. Tool outputs carry
a bounded preview and byte count. Full redacted inputs and outputs live in the
conversation's paired `.tools` directory; `conversation:tool-detail` retrieves
them. Details larger than 5 MB retain a bounded head and tail with `clipped:true`.

### Continuation channel and replay

The session input's `onSessionEvent` callback carries provider events after the
current send stream ends. A continuation opens a fresh `turn_started`, streams
its tools and approvals, and closes with `turn_completed` or `turn_failed`.
The runtime serializes these events with normal sends, mirrors the active turn,
and routes approval responses to the same provider session.

`src/main/conversation-session-api.ts` has no Electron dependency. It attaches a
live listener before reading catch-up, deduplicates by per-conversation `seq`,
and emits a synchronized marker before draining queued live events. Large
catch-ups use pages ending on user-turn boundaries. Commands with a client UUID
reuse one of the conversation's last 256 persisted receipts.

### Process lifecycle

The adapter keeps a session registry `sessionId → { query, child env marker,
lastTurnAt, pendingPermission }` and exposes `listLiveSessions()` +
`disposeAll()`. The SDK child is spawned with
`env.SPRINTENGINE_CONVERSATION_SESSION={sessionId}` so process-tree metrics can
attribute it. Idle reaping and quit disposal are wired separately, not here —
but dispose-with-resume must already work (stop keeps the cursor; next
`startSession` resumes).

## Rejected alternatives

- **Separate `StatefulConversationProviderAdapter` interface with its own
  runtime path** — doubles the runtime surface and forks event persistence;
  the event-stream model already accommodates mid-stream approvals.
- **Resume cursor in a settings/store sidecar** — the JSONL transcript is
  already the durable conversation record; a second store can desync and
  needs a new setter in two type surfaces (known typecheck trap).
- **Replaying our own history into the SDK** — defeats native resume, breaks
  subscription-side caching, and duplicates the CLI's own transcript.
