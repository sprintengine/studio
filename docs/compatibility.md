# Wire compatibility

Studio talks to software it does not ship with: another Studio on your tailnet,
the phone app, and the extensions people install into it. Both ends update on
their own schedule, so neither can assume the other is the same build. This
file is the policy for what that obliges you to do when you change something
that crosses the gap.

It is short on purpose. The one thing it must get across: **a wire format is not
a private data structure, and changing one is not a local edit.**

## What is versioned

| Wire                                                                                  | Version                                  | Window                                               | Declared in                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Tailnet transport — Studio driving another Studio                                     | `TAILNET_TRANSPORT_VERSION` (integer)    | `TAILNET_MIN_SUPPORTED_TRANSPORT_VERSION` .. current | `src/main/automation/tailnet/tailnet-routes.ts` |
| Mobile control — the phone reading and driving a desktop over the tailnet gateway     | `mobileControlProtocolVersion` (integer) | `mobileControlSupportedProtocolVersions`             | `src/main/mobile/control/protocol.ts`           |
| MCP                                                                                   | dated strings, newest first              | every entry in the list                              | `src/shared/mcp/protocol.ts`                    |
| Module host API — an installed extension built against `@sprintengine/module-sdk`     | `HOST_API_VERSION` (integer)             | `HOST_API_MIN_SUPPORTED` .. current                  | `src/shared/modules/host-api.ts`                |
| Studio protocol — a client on Studio's owner socket (`@sprintengine/studio-protocol`) | `STUDIO_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (integer)      | `STUDIO_PROTOCOL_MIN_SUPPORTED` .. current           | `packages/studio-protocol/src/handshake.ts`     |
| Embed `postMessage` — a page framing an embedded conversation (`se.embed`)            | `EMBED_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (integer, `v`)  | current only (one version of slack when 2 ships)     | `src/renderer/src/web/embed/embedProtocol.ts`   |

One more version number is near these and is **not** a wire window: the
backlog item schema version is a file format, and is not negotiated with a peer.
(`mobileControlWorkspaceSnapshotVersion` was a second; it versioned the mobile
snapshot's `workspaces` detail body and left the wire with it in v4.)

Alongside the tailnet version is `TAILNET_CAPABILITIES` — a list of named,
additive features. It is not a version and does not follow one; see
"Capabilities, not version arithmetic" below.

Three wires between this app and the Studio server trees it installs on a WSL
distribution or an SSH machine are private and are not in this table: the
bootstrap envelope, the front door's proof preamble (`FRONT_DOOR_PROOF_VERSION`)
and the conversation backend wire (`BACKEND_WIRE_VERSION`), and the SSH
relay's multiplexer (`MUX_VERSION` in `resources/wsl-server/relay-mux.mjs`).
Both ends are this app's own build: the tree is installed per app version and
checked by digest. An SSH machine can run another version's server (a newer
desktop installed it); the desktop then speaks to it only when it is this
version, upgrades an older managed one, and otherwise refuses in words
(`locateServer` in `src/main/environments/ssh/ssh-connect-script.ts`). Bump
`BACKEND_WIRE_VERSION` whenever a forwarded member's arguments or answer
change, and `MUX_VERSION` whenever a frame does.

## The support window

Both integer wires accept **one version of slack**: the current version and the
one before it. Anything outside is refused at the handshake, by a named error
that says both what was seen and what is supported.

- Tailnet: `checkTailnetTransportVersion` in `tailnet-routes.ts`, applied in
  `readRemoteIdentity` (`tailnet-remote-client.ts`). A machine outside the window
  is reported unreachable with the reason, and shown as such in the Remote panel.
- Mobile: `isSupportedMobileControlProtocolVersion`, and the
  `unsupported_protocol_version` error code. Enforced on inbound commands
  (`command-validation.ts`, behind `workspace.mobile_command`). The snapshot the
  desktop sends is stamped with the current version, and the phone reads it at
  that version only. The phone pairs through the tailnet gateway's own pairing,
  which is versioned by the tailnet transport, not by this integer.

One version, and not more, because the second version back is one this tree no
longer has to be able to produce, and a window wider than the shapes anyone
tests is a promise that quietly stops being true.

The window is also why the **refusal must name both numbers**. "Unsupported
protocol version" alone cannot tell someone which of their two installs to
update, which makes it a support thread instead of a fix.

## Capabilities, not version arithmetic

Where the question is "can this peer do X", ask the capability list, not the
version integer. A capability list is what the peer says about itself now; a
version is a proxy for it that goes stale in three ways — a feature can be
back-ported to an older version, withdrawn by a build that keeps the version, or
shipped behind a setting.

The tailnet transport advertises `capabilities` on `health`, on the pairing
response and on `identity`; `tailnetPeerSupports` is the accessor. A peer that
advertises no list has no capabilities, not all of them — but note that a peer
which published **no list** (null) is a different fact from one that published an
**empty list**, and only the second is a denial. The capability list shipped a
day after the first feature it describes, so silence there means "unknown".

This is what lets the version window stay narrow while the wire keeps growing: a
**purely additive** feature ships as a capability with no version bump at all, so
no peer is refused over it.

Bump the version instead when the change is not additive: a field that changes
meaning or type, a field that is removed, a response whose shape a peer is
already parsing. Nothing a capability flag can describe should bump the version,
and nothing a capability flag cannot describe should ship without one.

## The module host API

An extension is compiled against `@sprintengine/module-sdk` and runs inside
whatever Studio later loads it, so the contract between them — the `MainHost`
and `RendererHost` members, the services behind the SDK's `get*Service`
helpers, the manifest fields — is a wire in the sense of this file, even though
nothing crosses a network.

- **The version.** `HOST_API_VERSION = 1`, `HOST_API_MIN_SUPPORTED = 1`. Both
  are declared once, in `packages/module-sdk/src/host-api.ts`, and re-exported
  for app code by `src/shared/modules/host-api.ts`, so the app, the SDK and the
  `sprintengine-module` CLI cannot disagree about them. The drift guard
  (`npm run test:sdk:drift`) pins the two sides anyway.
- **The declaration.** A third-party manifest must carry
  `"engines": { "hostApi": <n> }`. First-party modules ship with the host they
  run on and may omit it.
- **The window.** A module loads when `HOST_API_MIN_SUPPORTED <= n <=
HOST_API_VERSION`. `checkHostApiCompatibility` is the one check; it is
  applied when modules are planned at startup (`src/main/modules/host-api-gate.ts`),
  when renderer entries are served (`third-party-renderer-entries.ts`), when a
  module's state is shown (`src/shared/modules/resolve.ts`, as
  `incompatible_host_api` rather than "not trusted"), and by the CLI's `sign`,
  `verify` and `pack`. A refusal names both numbers and which side to update —
  the same rule as the integer wires above.
- **Unlike the integer wires, the window is not one version wide by rule.** An
  extension is not a peer that updates alongside the app; raise
  `HOST_API_MIN_SUPPORTED` only when the host genuinely stops providing
  something older modules were promised, and say so in the SDK's
  `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Capabilities.** `host.supports(name)` answers what the running host
  provides now, from the table in `src/shared/modules/host-api.ts`
  (`hostSupports`). The names are the SDK's `HostCapability` union:
  `conversations`, `conversation-controls`, `conversation-streams`,
  `conversation-requests`, `conversation-permissions`, `chat.open`, `companion-agents`,
  `scheduled-agents`, `secrets`, `github`, `storage`, `mcp-tools`, `skills`,
  `module-assets`, `notifications`, and `electron-main`, which the main host
  answers itself: true in the desktop's own main process, false where a
  module's main half runs in the Studio server out of process.
- **`requires.hostCapabilities`.** An optional manifest field (added with
  `electron-main`, no version bump): a module whose `entry.main` cannot run
  without a capability names it, and a host that lacks it loads the module
  manifest-only (its renderer half still loads). The validator keeps names it
  does not know, since a host that does not know a name does not support it.
  A capability joins the table in the same change that makes it real, and an
  unknown name answers `false`. As on the tailnet, an additive feature ships as
  a capability with no version bump.
- **When to bump.** Removing or changing a host member, a service method or a
  manifest field that a module built for the current version may use. Adding
  an optional member, a service, a capability or a permission is additive.
  `scripts/release/sdk-release-check.mjs` (run by `npm run test:release`) checks
  that the version quoted here matches the source.

## The mobile wire lives in this tree

The mobile-control shapes — the snapshot the phone reads and the commands it
sends — are declared in `src/main/mobile/control/protocol.ts`, next to the
snapshot builder and command service that are their only producers here. They
used to ship as the `@sprintengine/mobile-control-protocol` package, when the
same wire also ran through a hosted relay; the relay was removed on 2026-09-27
(owner ruling) and the package with it. Its published `4.x` versions stay on
npm, and wire version 4 is what this tree still speaks, unchanged.

The phone app keeps its own copy of these types. Nothing compares the two
automatically any more, so a change that crosses the wire is made on both sides
in the same coordinated change, and the version integer is still the only thing
a peer sees.

### Direct conversation lane

`@sprintengine/conversation-protocol` is a separate portable package for the
additive `conversations` tailnet capability. It owns the direct conversation
WebSocket frames, their client validator and pure tool-presentation helpers,
and since `0.2.0` the whole conversation contract: the event layer, the
command vocabulary, create requests, the `hello` handshake and the capability
names. It does not change the mobile-control wire or its version number.

The lane has its own `CONVERSATION_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, answered by `hello` on a
desktop that advertises `conversation-hello`, with the same one-version window
rule as the integer wires above (`checkConversationProtocolVersion` names both
numbers). It is 1, and like them it moves only for a change a capability
cannot describe. `0.2.0` added three capabilities and no version:
`conversation-hello`, `conversation-plans` (`resolvePlan`) and
`conversation-cli-permission-modes` (a `permissionMode` beside the preset).
Each degrades on a desktop without it to something that desktop already does:
`hello` and `resolvePlan` are refused under their ids, and an unknown
`permissionMode` member is dropped, so the preset's own mode runs.

The initial `0.1.0` contract requires the `conversations` capability. Additive
optional fields preserve that contract. Model switching is one such addition: its own
`conversation-models` capability, a `models` catalog on a listed thread, the
`setModel` command, the `unsupported_model` code and a `notice` on an accepted
command. A client hides its model control for a desktop that does not
advertise it, and such a desktop refuses the command as `unsupported_command`.
The pictures a chat's steps show are another: the `conversation-images`
capability names a plain `GET /tailnet/v1/conversation-image` beside the socket
rather than a frame, so it changes neither the frame contract nor this package.
A client that does not see it says the picture is on the other machine, and an
older desktop answers the route 404. The machine each chat runs on (`host`),
its pull requests (`pullRequests`) and the desktop's own kind and colour
(`machine` on `identity`) are optional members with no capability: an older
phone ignores them, and a phone reads their absence as a desktop that does not
send them (`docs/conversations.md`, "Machines and pull requests in the list").
The context a chat has spent (`contextWindow` and `contextUsed` on a
`usage_updated` event) is the same kind of member: a phone that does not read
them shows no context ring, and one that does draws none for a desktop that
does not send them. Breaking frame changes require a new
negotiated capability or the tailnet version-window process above, not merely
a package version change. Presentation-only fixes use a package patch.
Both ESM and CommonJS tarball consumers and Node16 declarations are checked by
`npm run test:conversation-protocol:pack` as part of `verify:app`.

Until a published version is adopted, the phone carries the same portable source
files with a shared SHA-256 pin. A wire or presentation edit must update both
copies and both pins in companion changes; passing one repo's local hash check
alone does not prove the two peers agree. The pin covers `index.ts` and the four
files it re-exports; the package's entry is `public.ts`, which re-exports those
and the files added since, so an addition goes in a file of its own and leaves
the pin alone. Publishing is a separate release step.

### The Studio protocol

`@sprintengine/studio-protocol` is what Studio serves on its owner socket (a
Unix socket in `<userData>/run/`, or a named pipe on Windows) to the
applications on this machine a person has paired with it, and is the protocol
`@sprintengine/agent-sdk` speaks. It is a connection envelope — `hello` /
`welcome`, requests answered by id, subscriptions keyed by id — around the
conversation contract, which it depends on and re-exports rather than copies:
a stream's frames are the conversation lane's own server frames, and a
command's params are read by the lane's own validator. The phone's pinned
files are not touched by it.

`STUDIO_PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 1, with the same one-version window as the
integer wires above; `checkStudioProtocolVersion` refuses a peer outside it at
the handshake, naming both numbers, and the server answers that refusal as
`bye { code: 'unsupported_protocol_version' }`. Features are capabilities
(`conversations`, `conversation-create`, `local-pairing`, and the chat
surface's in `STUDIO_CHAT_CAPABILITIES`) advertised in the `welcome`, a Studio
leaving out any it does not serve; the conversation contract's own `protocolVersion` and capabilities
travel inside it, in `welcome.conversation`, unchanged. A new method or topic
is a capability, not a bump; so is a new server frame type (`push` was one),
since a client skips a frame type it does not know. Client tools are one such
capability within version 1: `client-tools` adds the `tools.*` methods and
stream, the server frames `call` and `cancel`, and the client frames `reply`
and `progress`. A Studio sends `call` only to a connection that offered a
toolset, and the SDK sends `reply` only to a Studio that advertised the
capability, so neither end is handed a frame type it does not know.
`files-write` adds the owner-only `files.*` by root, which the canvas uses
over a Studio's boards. `pull-requests` adds the owner-only `pullRequests.*`
methods and stream, and `pull-request-tool-calls` the one method a client that
runs its own agents forwards their tool calls with, `pullRequests.noteToolCall`,
and `pull-request-link` `pullRequests.link`, which records a pull request an
owner opened for a conversation (refused as `claimed` when another
conversation opened it first). A hello's `client.kind` and `client.instanceId` are
optional hints a Studio that does not know them ignores. Every method names its scope in `STUDIO_METHODS`,
typed over the method map so a method without one does not compile.

The pack check (`npm run test:studio-packages:pack`) installs the packed
tarball beside the conversation protocol's and checks both module systems and
Node16 declarations.

### The embed's `postMessage` wire

A page that frames Studio's embedded conversation view
(`/embed/conversation/<id>`) talks to the frame by `postMessage`, and the two
update separately: the frame is served by whichever Studio the embed points
at, the page by whoever wrote it. Every message carries an integer `v`, now 1.

- The frame posts `ready` (with the embed's id), `resize` (its content
  height), `link` (a link the person clicked, for the page to open), `state`
  (how many turns, and whether one is running) and `error` (a code). It posts
  only to the embed's registered origins, never `'*'`.
- The page may post `theme` (`light`, `dark` or `system`), `token` (the
  embed's token, for a page that keeps it out of the frame's address) and
  `scrollTo` (a turn). The frame accepts a message only from its parent and
  from a registered origin; it ignores a `type` it does not know and answers
  a `v` it does not know with `error { code: 'unsupported_version' }`.
- No message makes the frame send, answer or navigate. A new message type is
  additive and needs no bump; a change to an existing message's meaning bumps
  `v`, and the frame then accepts the old and the new for one version.

## Changing a wire format

If your change alters anything that crosses either wire, do all of this:

1. **Decide which it is.** Additive → a new entry in `TAILNET_CAPABILITIES` (or,
   for the phone, a new command in the snapshot's advertised `commands`, which
   the phone reads as plain strings), no version bump. Otherwise → a version bump.
2. **If you bump**, move the current version and the minimum together so the
   window stays one version wide, and leave the code that reads the previous
   shape in place for that one release. A bump that also drops the old reader
   refuses every peer that has not updated yet, which is what the window exists
   to prevent.
3. **Check every enforcement site.** They must agree, or a peer is accepted by
   one and refused by another. Today:
   `git grep -n 'protocolVersion' -- src | grep -v test` and
   `git grep -n 'transportVersion' -- src`. Note that the sites include the
   validators for records read back off **this machine's own disk** — a check
   pinned to the current version alone unpairs every device paired before the
   bump, silently, on the first restart after it.
4. **Test the edge, not the middle.** A peer inside the window is accepted, one
   outside it is refused, and the refusal names both versions. The existing
   examples are in `src/main/automation/tailnet-peers.test.ts`,
   `src/main/automation/tailnet-mesh-reachability.test.ts`,
   `src/main/mobile/control/command-validation.test.ts` and
   `src/main/mobile/control/protocol.test.ts`.
5. **Make the same edit on the phone.** The phone carries its own copy of the
   mobile-control types (see "The mobile wire lives in this tree" above), so a
   desktop-only change to a shape the phone parses is half a change. The window
   is the grace period a bump needs, not permission to skip the other side.
6. **Update this file**, if what you changed is the policy rather than an
   instance of it.

## Bumps that have happened

### 4 — the members nothing produces leave the wire (2026-09-16)

**Breaking, deliberately, and for the same reason as 3.** Taking the Sprint Engine
off the wire left members no desktop could produce: the `workspaces` collection
(always `[]`, with its `switchboard` / `watchtower` kinds, nine workspace
capabilities, detail shapes and the `desktopWorkspaces` snapshot collection), the
`roadmaps` rider, the always-`undefined` `statePath`, and the `python_tool_failed`
error code. All of it is deleted. `mobileControlProtocolVersion` moved 3 -> 4 and
the window moved with it, to `[3, 4]`. The package published `4.0.0`.

Removing `desktopWorkspaces` from the collection list is what makes this a bump
rather than a quiet tidy: a v3 phone that asked for it would now be refused with
`invalid_payload`.

As with 3, pre-release: no users and no paired devices. The phone's mirror moved
in the same coordinated change, with both sha256 pins set to the same new hash.
Step 2's one-release grace reader was skipped for the same reason as in 3; the
window is still one version wide and still enforced, and nothing reads v3.

The phone's project list and switcher were built from `workspaces` joined with
`backlog`. With `workspaces` always empty they were already built from `backlog`
alone, so the phone's projects are unchanged; only the dead join went.

The member-by-member list was in the protocol package's `CHANGELOG.md`, removed
with the package; `git show 84500b7f2:packages/mobile-control-protocol/CHANGELOG.md`
still has it.

### 3 — the Sprint Engine leaves the wire (2026-09-16)

**Breaking, and deliberately so.** `sprintEngines` was a required member of the
snapshot; the nine sprint commands, the eight sprint capabilities, their relay
scopes, the role catalogue and the `sprintengine` workspace kind were all wire
vocabulary. All of it is deleted. `mobileControlProtocolVersion` moved 2 -> 3 and
the window moved with it, to `[2, 3]`. The package published `3.0.0`.

**Why it could not be additive.** The Sprint Engine moved out of the
desktop into a signed module, and the desktop stopped being able to serve any of
it. It kept emitting `sprintEngines: []` anyway, and the phone kept demanding
the key, because removing a required member is not additive: a desktop that
dropped it while the phone still required it would fail EVERY snapshot read on
the phone with `invalid_payload`, taking backlog and automations down with the
runs. Emitting an empty array forever was the right answer while a paired phone
existed. It also meant the wire carried a large vocabulary — a whole run type
tree, nine commands, eight capabilities — that nothing on either side could
produce or act on.

**What made it possible.** Pre-release: no users, no published consumers, no
paired devices to protect. Both halves — this package and the phone's mirror of
it — moved in one coordinated change, with both sha256 pins set to the new shared
hash in that same change.

**Where this departs from step 2 below.** Step 2 says a bump leaves the code that
reads the previous shape in place for one release, so the window is a grace
period rather than an outage. That was skipped on purpose here: there is no
deployed peer to grant grace to, and a retained v2 reader would have been a copy
of exactly the vocabulary the change exists to delete. The window itself is still
one version wide and still enforced; nothing reads v2.

The member-by-member list was in the protocol package's `CHANGELOG.md`, removed
with the package; `git show 84500b7f2:packages/mobile-control-protocol/CHANGELOG.md`
still has it.

## Withdrawals that did not bump

### Terminals leave the tailnet (2026-09-29)

**Not a bump, and the tailnet transport stays at 2.** Owner ruling: nothing
about a terminal crosses the tailnet any more; what a paired device reads,
drives and starts is a conversation. Everything that went is one of the shapes
this file already says a peer must tolerate, so no peer on version 1 or 2 is
refused over it:

- **Two capabilities withdrawn**, `sliced-frames` and `terminal-resume`. Both
  described the terminal stream. A capability is what a peer asks before relying
  on a feature, and a build that stops advertising one is read as not having it
  — the case "withdrawn by a build that keeps the version" above.
- **The route**, `/tailnet/v1/terminal`. An upgrade there is answered 404, which
  is what a peer from before the route existed answered.
- **Five tools off the tailnet**, `terminal.list`, `terminal.create`,
  `agent.launch`, `backlog.work` and `automation.run`. All five still exist and
  are served on the local socket, to the agents and MCP clients on this machine;
  a paired device's `tools/list` no longer names them, and a call to one is
  refused as `tailnet_local_only`, the refusal the `tailnet.*` family already
  had. `tools/list` is read on every connection and never pinned, so a shorter
  list is a shape every peer already reads.
- **A change-feed kind**, `terminals`. No `changed` frame names it, and the
  `hello` frame's `revisions` map no longer has its key. That map is keyed by
  the lists this machine announces and has grown a key before (`conversations`)
  without a bump; a key a build does not announce is absent, the same as it was
  before the key existed.
- **Two scopes**, `terminal:observe` and `terminal:control`, retired the way the
  Horizon scopes were: `normalizeTailnetScopes` drops a scope outside the
  vocabulary, so a device stored with them loads with the rest of its grant, a
  pair request naming them is read without them, and a peer reading a grant
  list sees a shorter list, which a grant list always could be.
- **The upload route** keeps its path, its `upload` capability and its
  conversation shape. Its terminal branch — a file written into a session's
  folder — is gone, and the `kind=conversation` older phones send is accepted
  and no longer needed.

The phone's side of this is its own change: it stops asking for terminals.
Nothing in `src/main/mobile/control/protocol.ts` changed, so the mobile-control
version stays at 4.

### Automations leave the phone (2026-09-29)

**Not a bump, and the mobile-control version stays at 4, window `[3, 4]`.**
Owner ruling: the phone does not show or drive automations any more. What
left `src/main/mobile/control/protocol.ts`:

- **The snapshot member** `automations`, with its types
  (`MobileControlAutomationSnapshot`, `MobileControlAutomationRunSummary`,
  `MobileControlAutomationRunStatus`) and the producer's caps
  (`automationsPerProjectMax`, `automationRecentRunsMax`,
  `automationRunTextMaxChars`). The member was optional and already absent
  whenever a desktop had no automations to show, so a snapshot without it is
  one every v3 and v4 phone reads. That is why this is not the case "a field
  that is removed" in the bump rule above: nothing about whether it may be
  absent changed.
- **The collection** `automations` from `mobileSnapshotCollections`. This is
  the part that would have been a bump — it is what made v4 one — because
  phones built before this ask for `['backlog', 'automations']` on every read,
  and `workspace.snapshot` refuses a name it does not know. So the name is kept
  as a retired collection (`retiredMobileSnapshotCollections`): accepted in
  `include`, and answered with nothing, the way the upload route still accepts
  the `kind` older phones send.
- **The command** `automations.control`, with `AutomationsControlCommand`,
  `MobileControlAutomationAction` and the `task_not_ready` error code only it
  produced. A command is advertised in the snapshot's `commands` strings, and
  the tailnet never advertised this one: the gateway's `workspace.mobile_command`
  allowlist is `backlog.update` alone, so since the hosted relay went
  (2026-09-27) no transport served it. A phone that sends it is refused
  `command_not_supported` by the gateway, as before.

The phone's mirror drops the same members in its own companion change. On the
desktop, automations are unchanged, and `automation.run` stays a local-socket
tool.

## What never changes without a bump

- The meaning of an existing field.
- The type of an existing field.
- Whether an existing field may be absent.
- The shape of anything under `health` on the tailnet transport, which is read by
  peers that have never paired with us and may be several releases behind.
